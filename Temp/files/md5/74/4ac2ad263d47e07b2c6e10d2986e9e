disappointing service plane interior and terribly incompetent customer service i booked my flight directly through ba s website soon after i started to get email saying my selected seat i paid extra for the selection had been changed by ba without any reason given and i wa directed to the website there i found no information on the said seat change this happened several time i had flight altogether the website seems to be a digital dinosaur the first leg of my flight wa fine until i discovered in the transfer area at heathrow that i forgot my new laptop onboard immediately i contacted ba s so called customer service what an oxymoron which basically said they can not do anything i would have to wait until the cleaner working for a contractor would have finished their job and hope they would discover the laptop and return it to so called lost found at the airport ba s customer service said they couldn t contact their colleague in the terminal gate were the plane wa still and let them know there wa a lost laptop by seat no a of the plane yes i told them exactly were the laptop wa they wouldn t take any contact detail either to notify me if and when the laptop would be returned and they refused to register the incident they simply had no interest in assisting me and didn t even make an attempt to pretend they did communication via their online customer service wa poor and they didn t even respond to my message in the end i emailed the representative at heathrow and he replied with a message form his supervisor which did not reveal his name it is not the duty of british airway to find lost property on behalf of our passenger however if you would like to dispute this you can contact customer relation online with further feedback they took no responsibility and referred me to smartecarte which is the contractor cleaning their plane and apparently collecting lost item at heathrow i have not received the laptop worth thousand gbp back now week later the flight between london and cape town hour were unpleasant the flight attendant were seemingly unenthusiastic about their job it took up to an hour to collect the trash after the meal which also wa distributed extremely slowly food wa not good boarding wa slow and inefficient drink were only offered twice otherwise you d have to ask for it especially on this long flight the seat were of fabric uncomfortable and room too scarce to relax and sleep all in all flying with british airway wa disappointing and i will not be keen on flying with them again,negative
a transit visa is required for my partner to transit via london to iceland so i had to buy a separate ticket for her via another airline when we reach iceland i emailed british airway telling then she won t be using her return ticket and requested for a partial refund day later i received an email from customer service that i need to contact one of their service centre via the provided link i replied to say the link only go to a page with various british landline phone number to call and explained that i am overseas then and it will not be practical to do this via international call they replied to say i can only do this by contacting the service centre so the airline end up taking my money regardless,positive
i wa surprised to receive confirmation pre flight that i had kg luggage allowance this to be later confirmed a one at kg checked in another kg carry on for under seat and a third kg carry on for overhead stowage checkin opened a bit late and the line for executive club member even later but wa courteous and efficient long queue for passport control but the fault of brexit not ba my seat had no screen no earphone socket no charge point no seat recline no boarding music all the same a low cost carrier captain announced wonderful service from emily and crew maybe it wa in club class not the economy cabin it wa announced that they would serve complimentary water and snack but only the snack came it wa also announced there would be free text messaging for exec club member but i couldn t get it to work although a member snack were sold some at twice tui price for example cadbury s chocolate finger at i chose ba this time a when i booked it wa cheaper than all the charter carrier and being british i mustn t forget ba s impeccable safety record and normally reliable service after landing the purser thanked the crew for their hard work seems pushing one small cart down the aisle during four hour constitutes hard work in ba but at least we were on time,positive
flight cancelled not refunding our money saying we took the flight that never happened not refunding the new flight we booked hotel food while we were stranded did not provide food or water while waiting for hour on tarmac will not provide information a to why they aren t refunding the flight that never happened saying there is no more information,negative
i had visa issue and hence wa debarred from flying the ground staff at mumbai wa excellent a woman named brinelle wa very helpful and understanding i had to rebook my ticket and while the original journey wa consisting of leg ba forced me to rebook the entire ticket because their system did not allow them to rebook just that one leg even though there wa a gap of day between the two leg not like they were connecting flight the telephone operator wa rude took minute and kept saying she needed more minute to give me clarity it wa horrendous the final price they offered me for rebooking of the leg wa much more than the original fare for all leg she wa torturous ba wa horrendous because the website doe not allow you to do all this a very poor experience in all,negative
singapore to heathrow with ba two choice on this route a or in economy and premium and first there isn t much in it in club world the win a it ha the suite check in wa easy security and passport control in singapore is efficient choice of lounge ba qantas or qatar the latter win easily ba lounge wa ok no major negative qantas win on space boarding wa on time the aircraft ha a high density club world cabin service wa fine club suite wa good it s the food and beverage that are being targeted i feel the st meal starter wa good main of beef fillet wa average same sentiment for cheese wine were acceptable champagne choice is cheap so i did not try service for meal efficient given the full cabin breakfast wa similar the menu suggested that some might want to skip a main course and opt for starter and dessert for this to work for ba a major shift in how lounge option are sourced and presented would be needed a it wa i slept well we arrived early luggage off quickly for once so a reasonable flight overall my warning to ba is that food and beverage in club world are drifting in the wrong direction,positive
i recently travelled from munich to london with british airway and it turned into an absolute nightmare our trouble began with their malfunctioning app despite checking in successfully i wa unable to retrieve our boarding pass upon arrival at the airport we discovered that there were no self service kiosk and the check in desk were completely unattended after seeking help from the information desk we were directed to a staff member who clearly did not want to assist u her dismissive attitude wa infuriating and despite showing her the app indicating we were checked in she simply told u to call customer service and walked away without providing any assistance after being put on hold for minute and being sent to several different staff member who couldn t help u we finally reached someone on the phone who wa kind but ultimately powerless to resolve our issue by this point our flight wa delayed and we had wasted two hour just trying to print our boarding pass when i followed up with a complaint british airway basically dismissed my concern and told me to use the app next time ignoring the fact that it wa the app s failure that caused all these problem in the first place this experience cost u a staggering in additional expense including new flight hotel stay taxi fare and fine missing work and explaining this absurd situation to my employer wa incredibly embarrassing british airway clearly need to improve it customer service and technology if their app and website are going to fail they must provide adequate support at the airport i will never fly with them again and i urge others to consider alternative airline,negative
i paid for seat a and b on my flight from heathrow to boston on the a paying for premium economy seat upon arrival at the airport the ticket agent said i wa not healthy enough to sit in the purchased seat due to being too old i presume since there is no other reason i can find i could not sit in the exit seating i am healthy enough to walk mile a day and have adequate upper body strength attempting to convince her just got u stuck in a cattle call seat at the rear of the aircraft second floor and in the middle two seat of the row we were told our money would be refunded immediately for the inconvenience after several week i recontacted ba and they said the complaint went to the wrong section and they were forwarding it to the next section week later and we still have not heard any update except for a computer response stating most refund were returned in week keep waiting the plane then had ground difficulty and needed a quick repair they completed that minute later and boarded the flight the captain then came on and said it look like they forgot to order the ground crew to back u out of the terminal and we needed to wait another minute we were not able to make up for the lost time in the air we landed hour later than scheduled wreaking havoc with our next flight,negative
the flight wasn t that bad although the inflight entertainment wasn t great the screen wa very old fashioned it wa hard to operate in the dark a the touch screen wasn t working at time there wa though a remote the cabin crew slamming air larder oven and draw apart from that the cabin crew were nice the food wa good and the seat wa comfortable,positive
i decided to treat myself and my teenage daughter to world traveller plus on the return leg of our canada holiday paying hundred of pound extra to do so only to end up spending nine and a half hour trapped in a broken seat staring at a blank screen after both our entertainment system failed to work i hadn t bought a book or uploaded a film because i had assumed i would be enjoying the entertainment ba had promised so i decided to lie back and get some rest instead only to discover that the leg rest on my seat didn t work the flight attendant wa able to prop it up manually by shoving thing underneath but unfortunately this only made matter worse because it became firmly stuck in the up position forcing my body into an awkward position during the descent when i had to keep my seatback upright leaving me with back pain that lasted three day i have a bad lower back early on in this experience i asked to be moved to economy so that i could sit normally and watch a film but the flight wa full and there wa no space the apologetic flight attendant assured me i would receive compensation which i assumed meant the airline would at the very least upgrade u the next time we flew ba since we had been unable to enjoy any of the advertised benefit of world traveller plus the two of u only had one suitcase each so hadn t made use of the extra baggage allowance ba s actual compensation offer worth of avios point each i wrote back since ba doesn t allow you to have any direct telephone contact with their complaint department explaining firmly but politely that this wa not fair or acceptable given the hundred of extra pound i d paid for added extra the airline had failed to deliver they then ghosted me my experience is a cautionary tale about british airway customer support if all go to plan you may well have a very pleasant world traveller plus experience but if anything should go wrong support staff will wash their hand of you and your money will have been wasted so unless you re prepared to gamble i would advise you to either stick with economy world traveller since then you re only really paying to fly from a to b which they do manage to do or fly with another airline or you could end up like me throwing away extra money on an experience that fell far below the standard of economy class if your flight is to canada i would recommend an airline such a air canada which i turned to during the uncertainty of the covid pandemic because of their exceptional customer service and fast no nonsense refund they do cost a bit more so when life returned to normal post covid i started flying ba again believing such high standard of customer service were no longer important i now see that this wa both a mistake and a false economy one that ha ended up costing me hundred of wasted pound,negative
i wa very impressed with their efficient boarding the relatively compared to air canada comfortable seat and the quality of the food drink and snack frequently offered overall a no fuss no bother experience,positive
the flight scheduled at left hour minute alter due to late arrival of incoming aircraft from naples a a result i missed a connection from istanbul to dubai nothing unusual the issue acknowledged by the captain is that the plane had been late since the morning flight from rome with rolling effect until the evening a this wa the case whey did ba not contact me and all other passenger i could have made other arrangement and fly early to istanbul and not miss my connection resulting in a charge and a long delay ba ha certainly lot of staff who could have informed by using the email or text obviously passenger are of no utility to ba once the ticket is purchased who can trust ba to travel not me now after such poor handling of a simple matter,negative
i have been flying ba for over year i wa an american airline ff and gave it up for ba i am a gold member on ba and have been for over year here are the thing i have noticed over the last year on ba the flight attendant are getting lazier and complacent from cleaning bathroom to serving meal the food on ba ha deteriorated to the point of not being able to eat the garbage they give you and having gold status is almost meaningless in the big scheme of thing i have never been able to upgrade to business or first using the avios point i have accumulated on a transcon flight i fly ba now because it the only partner of american airllines that i can easily get to europe i have switched back to aa ff program and is already so much better ba used to be a splendid airline and now it just another poor airline in the european market,positive
on arriving at mexico airport we were told that the flight wa delayed because the aircraft had broken down and the replacement aircraft from lhr wa about six hour late when we eventually managed to check in we told that contrary to the ba website we could not have access to the hour grand lounge elite and instead would use the american airline admiral club lounge which would close three hour before the flight left after that we would have to use a restaurant and were given a food voucher two hour before the flight wa due to leave were then informed that the aircraft had diverted to cancun because of a volcanic ash cloud over mexico city although it did not appear to be affecting other flight into the airport including those from europe they eventually arranged taxi to take u to a hotel and we arrived at am we were assured that we would all be on a ba flight leaving the same time the following day the only contact after that wa a local employee who stayed at the hotel he said that he wa there to organise transport and refused to give u any other contact detail when we eventually did need transport the following day he had disappeared during the night we were then sent an email telling u that we were booked onto an air canada flight leaving at am this would have been impossible with such short notice and without canadian epa authorisation we then spent two hour trying to make contact with ba it mexico number did not work and eventually we were put on an aeromexico flight in economy they told u to check in a soon a we could but this meant we had to pay an extra for the seat later after a very long call we were told that we could be upgraded to business with aeromexico despite having been told earlier that there wa no availability ba then informed u that because we had already checked in a they had suggested we could not be moved and this took three more call to aeromexico to sort out i totally understand that aircraft break down but the onus should be on the airline to rearrange and not the passenger we were lucky because we took the trouble of making the call to the uk but others such a a disabled lady had been told nothing when we left,negative
i have flown british airway for many year and still do so regularly in one of my last flight this past summer between paris and boston british booked me on a connecting flight between paris and london that gave me a maximum of minute to connect in london london heathrow is a massive airport where going from terminal to terminal could take minute once you deplane not including the actual time to deplane if you are seated in the back and line at passport control and security between terminal so already one is pressed for time my flight from paris to london that day wa tardy minute tardy that day to be exact ba flight in fact is routinely tardy don t bother with this one flight connection assisted me by calling the new gate to let them know my previous flight had been delayed and that i wa rushing to the gate it wa minute before my connecting flight wa to depart i ran like a fool for minute carryons and all arriving to the gate minute before my flight wa to depart only to be greeted by no plane the agent said that since no one knew where i wa false the plane left without me early gaining a few minute wa more important than an passenger inconvenienced by their own delay so i made the minute trek back to flight connection knowing that they would have to rebook me the following day i wa now going to miss the wedding i wa destined to attend in boston they sent me to a prepaid hilton hotel room for the night but told me that i would have to pay pound each way for a taxi to take me there they gave me a pamphlet with instruction for reimbursement this wa in early july it took me month and a complaint to the british centre for effective dispute resolution to be reimbursed for the equivalent of there wa no apology no recognition not even a free drink coupon for that next flight i won t ever take with british like a bad insurance claim british just kept denying my claim expecting that i would just go away well i am going away i m taking my and using another airline for future travel,negative

british airway charge you for the pleasure of choosing your seat and i had been put at the very back of club which turned out to be an advantage because it meant i could get to the seat without having to climb over anybody the seat wa clean but a i later discovered that the foldout section would not stay up and your foot dangled over the edge when the bed wa extended after boarding wa complete we were told that departure wa delayed because ba had not loaded all of the cargo we were then told that it wa delayed further because there wa a fault with one of the fuel pump it took over five hour for this problem to be corrected a the pilot later informed u that they installed new pump having initially thought that it wa a software issue during that time we were served the meal but were told that alcohol is not permitted which wa curious given that we had already been served a pre departure drink most of the cabin crew were male and apparently based in mexico and this turned out to be a pleasant surprise given that those i spoke to were incredibly positive and friendly but seemed embarrassed at what wa happening i knew that it wa the old style seat but what wa less acceptable is ba s petty penny pinching if there wa a competition for the smallest hot towel ba would be the winner the food sounded nice and looked impressive but seemed totally tasteless,positive
what is wrong with you guy people pay lot of money for a business class ticket but you sit squeezed into a seat with no legroom nothing is clean the overhead locker are empty and they want you to put your bag under the seat so that you have no room for your leg anymore and then serve you food that is just rubbish the staff demonstrates it s british arrogance with no manner there is no decent polite service anymore there is really no difference to easyjet at all it s the same on their european route,negative
we booked two business class seat with british airway in july for the flight on september we were told on september at the heathrow airport that our flight wa cancelled and we could only have one business seat with another flight to a different airport no one from the british airway contacted u to apologize and to offer refund for the business class seat we lost we filed a complaint to the british airway and asked for reimbursement on september and have not heard a word from them a of october it is the worst flight experience we have ever had terrible customer service zero communication with customer we cannot even find a phone number to call the british airway on it website,negative
i ve flown with many airline but my recent experience with british airway left much to be desired the in flight entertainment wa underwhelming and i wa disappointed by the lack of basic amenity such a a comfort kit with essential like eye mask while the only positive aspect wa the slightly more generous legroom overall i found the service to be far below expectation not impressed,positive
i recently flew from new york back to london with ba this wasn t my first long haul with them however it wa my first time travelling in world traveler plus we boarded the aircraft on time and stress free and my first impression wa good the cabin wa clean and the leg room wa good the recline on the seat wa generous and combined with a footrest it wa quite comfortable waiting on our seat wa a decent quality cushion and blanket a well a an amenity kit the amenity kit contained some good headphone sock an eye mask lip balm pen and toothbrush and toothpaste once boarding wa complete we were offered a pre departure drink with orange juice water or champagne being the option the crew were all very friendly and professional and did their upmost to ensure that everyone wa happy once in the air we were offered a hot towel and another round of drink this time with a lot more selection drink were offered several time throughout the flight a menu wa also handed out not long after take off the starter wa quinoa and for main there wa a choice of chicken meatball and pasta or a vegetarian mushroom dish i chose the meatball and they were really good my only real complaint about the flight wa people not getting the dish they wished for we were sat in the last row of the premium economy cabin and by the time the meal service got to u all of the chicken dish were gone the moral of the story is that if you sit at the front of the cabin you will likely get your preferred meal option after the meal i chose to watch some show on the well sized entertainment screen ba is definitely up there for best inflight entertainment finally about an hour before landing we were served a breakfast snack this come in the form of a warm egg and swiss cheese bagel it wa edible but also a little soggy and didn t really taste of much i certainly wont be craving one anytime soon we touched down into heathrow on time before disembarking the aircraft and picking up our bag everything wa very efficient and we were on our way in no time,positive
ba business class in europe ha a seat the same a economy you simply have an empty seat next to you and so for many the only true benefit are in flight meal lounge access and priority security etc the problem on this flight wa a small child aged around five who sang incessantly in an extremely loud voice throughout most of the flight i am aware of the difficulty of flying with child i know it is difficult to keep them entertained etc i am a patient person i have headphone the parent of this child chose despite a polite request not to try and quieten their child at all at this point one had an expectation the crew will step in if i wa singling loudly disrupting other passenger they would quite rightly ask me to desist so why not speak to the parent of a child who is doing the same and disrupting the rest and sleep of other passenger instead having served the meal the crew retreated behind their curtain and left the passenger to stew simply not good enough a for wifi forget it,positive

british airway world traveller plus premium economy product need some improvement to justify the high cost over economy yes the seat and leg room are far superior and on this flight the crew were excellent however lunch dinner wa only average wine selection wa poor and like some other airline ba provides a revolting snack prior to landing the same snack is served in economy choice of entertainment also requires improvement if ceo sean doyle is serious about elevating ba to one one of the world s best airline which it once wa then work is needed to provide a better customer experience,positive

a someone who fly relentlessly with british airway for business and pleasure generally for the routing and who is a gold frequent flier we ve come to accept the shocking food service exorbitant price and outdated plane when you get on a plane the primary role of the crew is your safety however when said crew look like they have just fallen out of bed cannot dress themselves properly or in the case of men find a razor you do question there ability to react in an emergency situation enough said,positive

cargo service that s how i felt in the a upper deck supposedly nicer than the main deck for business but packed in on the configuration head to tail a ba love to configure it seat to make more money i failed to enjoy business class or feel like it wa worth the money the lie flat seat do that a narrow a they are and only by lowering the foot rest the foot rest over which the person not on the aisle i wa on the aisle ha to step or crawl to get to the aisle one can get a couple of fitful hour of sleep but only with luck the seat control on the a are primitive and antiquated the food served wa a bit better than coach but only minimally so well cooked dead supposedly scottish salmon salad with tough bit of green if i d paid coach price for this i d have been sort of pleased but business class ba continues to hoover money out of flyer pocket for minimal quality and charge all but their higher grade of customer for the privilege of choosing seat in advance of hr check in some of their newer plane have the more traditional all facing forward business class but many do not it s really a gamble whether you ll get a pod in business or simply a lie flat space next to many of your new found friend and be awakened by them it s really time for ba to either reduce their business class price to reflect the mediocre product or step up and re allocate space for normal business pod seat all through their fleet,positive
inefficient and slow airport operation resting on their laurel many staff standing around doing very little at terminal yet not completing their basic task i had to return three time for them to properly do the document check fee a bad a ryanair for any extra average somewhere below easyjet above ryanair for now presumably that s what they re aiming for,negative
the customer service is one of the worst i have ever seen they will scheme and give you untruth we were not allowed on our original flight because of some technical issue on their end and had to call the airline because they could not do anything at the counter additional later we are booked on the next flight in hour we paid for service on the original flight and asked for it to be moved nothing happened we had to pay for the service all over again next the second connecting flight we sat on the tarmac for over two hour then we deplaned at midnight without going anywhere they did not even give u an hotel we had to spend the night at the airport they gave u a flight the enxt day from london to zurich but it wa three connecting flight with an hour gap each london brussels amsterdam zurich absolute nonsense the first flight itself wa delayed so of course we missed all the other connection and they would not pick up the phone or help u nothing we had zero help from ba and had to spend hour at brussels ariport sorting out and buying new ticket ourselves we are out over at this point with zero response from ba to reimburse u for their planning our final flight to india from zurich wa also delayed we sat on the tarmac for hour before the flight finally took off cost,negative
before my flight i wa forced by the ground staff to check in my new expensive cabin luggage despite the fact that it met all size requirement i wa informed that the plane wa full and assured by staff that my luggage would be well taken care of unfortunately when my bag wa returned to me it wa scratched and damaged this is completely unacceptable especially given the assurance i received when i lodged a complaint it fell on deaf ear there ha been no acknowledgment or resolution from british airway the funny thing is that the overhead locker were empty this experience ha been extremely frustrating and disappointing the lack of care for both customer property and customer service is glaring,negative

an excellent flight despite this being a hour flight in a a that is configured for short hop to edinburgh or glasgow and despite there being no ife i ended up really enjoying the flight i don t know if it wa just that i had really low expectation but i thought the crew were fabulous and the food and wine wa surprisingly good the plane itself looked very new and wa in perfect condition from the very start i really liked the crew they were all cheerful genuine and clearly enjoying their work i noticed they constantly had friendly and proactive interaction with passenger and when the food and drink came around they were generous with the wine and happily provided top ups later in the flight the food box wa deceptively small it actually contained a decent selection of food and wa more than enough to keep me feeling satisfied on this trip there were regular and detailed update from the cockpit which i also appreciated so whilst the hard product on this flight were limited it wa the service and the genuine enjoyment of the crew that won me over,positive
i recently traveled with british airway and had a mixed experience booking and check in the booking process wa straightforward but our experience at the baggage counter wa frustrating while we were in line the three employee at the counter took a minute break before processing our luggage which caused unnecessary delay flight the flight to london wa fine and we enjoyed our time in the lounge during our layover despite the delay the connecting flight to dfw wa also fine baggage issue unfortunately our luggage did not make it onto our flight to dfw we arrived at dfw on wednesday and a of we still have not received our luggage customer service the most disappointing aspect ha been the customer service they have been dismissive and no one ha taken responsibility or provided a timeline for when our bag will be delivered overall while the flight themselves were okay the baggage handling and customer service ha been horrible,negative
my family and i were booked to leave london for hong kong on august after having been made to wait at the airport for hour we were told at midnight that our aircraft had bee struck by lightning and our flight wa cancelled everyone wa sent home we had to scramble to find transportation and were told to wait for re routing information we were booked to travel two day later to hk via the middle east with an hour stopover needless to say we refused this flight the worst trick by ba is that all our original flight booking reference were deleted from their system and we can therefore not apply for compensation of any of our additional transportation hotel and meal cost i cannot find the word to express my anger not a much a an apology ha been received,negative
we had to change from aa to ba for a flight to london because of a missed connection the flight wa ok but in the process our bag were delayed we waited for day at our destination reading regular unhelpful update from ba about receiving our luggage and finally had to return to the airport twice to pick them up personally because no one lifted a hand to take them off the carousel we have now waited month and counting for a claim to be processed this is absolutely the worst experience i ve had in year of plane travel the company ha cleverly designed their website and phone tree to deter contact their live chat guide you by asking if you want to chat about a booking or something else in spite of entering no to the option about asking about a booking it take you there anyway just like being on a baggage carousel with no one attending or caring at least i m not alone judging from the number of similar complaint about how terribly they treat customer,negative
after paying for ticket for my family including having to pay over just to sit together a we were traveling with kid they ran out of chicken dinner my kid are picky and wont eat vegetarian curry i dont mind the curry in fact i thought it wa pretty good but at least maybe feed the kid first or check i don t understand how you can run out when we have to pay so much the only explanation to me is that the airline is greedy and will try to save a nickel than make everyone happy i m just disappointed in british airway,positive

it is embarrassing to have the word british attached to this airline the service wa substandard in every way with the possible exception of food and a couple of stand out staff i can accept delay and technical problem they happen how they handled it wa in my opinion wa not responsible they left everyone on the plane for hour and at midnight disembarked saying they had no hotel available and no staff to unload luggage the plane inevitable had people with young child and elderly all left to fend for themselves several time they mentioned don t worry we have a duty of care but there really wa none singapore to london flight wa not wifi enabled and they cram business class seat across the width comfort and service did not reflect price and wa well below leading airline avoid it at all cost,negative

british airway oversold my lhr to lax flight i booked month in advance paid in full and actually paid over extra to fly their airbus a tried to check in online day before flight got unknown system error couldn t check in arrived at lhr hour early none of ba kiosk worked all manual check in by understaffed ba staff who were all unhelpful insane queue time lot of other frustrated passenger in line denied boarding at the gate because flight oversold no explanation no apology constantly ignored by ba staff who don t have the patience to listen to your situation or be helpful finally gate manager book alternate flight to paris cdg supposedly to connect with an air france flight we get to cdg only to be told by air france their flight wa full no idea why ba manager bumped me to af flight that s also full that s insult to injury to be bumped twice went to ba desk at cdg no help at all they told u to call ba and couldn t even provide the phone number just told u to look online on top of all that my luggage is lost somewhere between ba and af in paris cdg i m an american citizen and speak perfect english but i feel completely humiliated and treated like second class citizen by multiple ba staff through the whole ordeal mostly they just ignore you or bounce you from one counter to another without even trying to listen to your problem zero accountability will never ever fly ba again absolute worst travel experience of my life,negative
i travelled london to doha on july th i had to physically check in at ba business t because i had an ongoing connection in doha and the flight wa a code share with qatar i had paid for my flight through qatar and paid for the seat online so i could sit where i like to sit and when i got to check in discovered i had been reseated elsewhere in the cabin and wa told that wa their policy and basically to shut up about it i then discovered that ba do not recognise qatar frequent flyer rule despite sharing avios point i m a gold card holder in qatar which affords me extra kilo on the baggage but ba tried to tell me i had to pay after some arguing eventually they accepted it the lounge wa packed staff less than helpful when i tried to get some answer on my seat reassignment i wa told i would get my money back no chance of that so don t even try the flight boarded by bus the journey took minute to get from terminal to aircraft which i am guessing wa at another terminal because it took so long to get there why not board u through that terminal rather than drag u all over the airport finally got onto the plane ba staff are not friendly it s no wonder they are ranked th i now realise it s a privilege being allowed to step onto a ba flight and it departed minute late myself and many other traveller had connection and this meant i wa either going to miss the connection or i would manage to make the connection but my luggage wouldn t would ba flight crew help me on board to figure out the connection they eventually came to tell me me in their haughty attitude we are now landing minute earlier so that give you a full minute to make your connection landing early doe not mean getting to the gate earlier it usually take at least minute from landing to gate then another for the jetway to be attached and if you are lucky to be sitting near the door straight off if not minute to disembark if you want to be helpful don t say stupid thing to people who are frequent traveller a it turned out i wa sitting near the door and had to run off the plane qatar were there to assist but i did have to run from the a gate all the way to c gate to make my connection not a short distance for a year old and the luggage did not make it many others were not a fortunate and didn t make their connection why put a page in the flight entertainment for connection if you are not going to provide the information it s public information you can look it up on line so the aircraft ha access to wifi and satellite communication so i fail to understand why this information cannot be captured and displayed i complained to ba got a wishy washy email with a number of excuse in it no mention of the seat refund i got a paltry voucher that i m supposed to use on another ba flight who are they kidding i am not sure i want to experience that again however i have recently discovered that of my frequently travelled to destination is really only serviced by ba if i want to fly at a reasonable hour of the day or go all over europe just to avoid them which is too expensive i consider them one of the worst airline i have ever flown and getting worse by the minute fly them only if you absolutely have to and good luck,negative

if you can t fly first class don t fly british airway very uncomfortable seat you can t even get out of your seat when the person in front ha their seat reclined and who doesn t need to recline their seat you can t pick up anything off the floor during the flight because you can t bend to touch the floor there isn t enough space to if you have long leg don t think you are going to be comfortable a soon a the person in front of you put their chair back your knee will be crushed terrible food terrible plane terrible air hostess terrible flight and unfortunately i have to fly back home with them,negative
singapore to heathrow business class on an a is a premium economy plus experience from the economy class sized toilet to the badly designed coffin shaped business class pod the experience is a substandard business class experience business class pod s storage is a small drawer at the foot of the pod the privacy screen are opaque plastic sheet so you are kept awake by your neighbour a their screen light up your pod when the seat is made into it coffin shaped bed the cold hard plastic seat mould are an unpleasant surprise for those that turn in their sleep you have a choice of having your neighbour step over your calf height footrest hopefully not brushing your foot with theirs or having to step over your neighbour s foot footrest with the footrest down heaven forbid you try to lever yourself into a more comfortable position a the slightest pressure cause the footrest to collapse into it floor level position if you are in the aisle seat which is open to the aisle kiss goodbye to any privacy a not only will you be on view to all passenger the crew will lean you to both serve your neighbour their food and talk to your neighbour over your privacy screen,positive

on march st i flew from berlin to s o paulo with ba but encountered several issue my first flight wa delayed by several hour causing me to miss my connection at london heathrow upon arriving at the airport after midnight i wa given a hotel voucher however the hotel designated by ba rudely denied me check in claiming it wa fully booked i had to return to heathrow at am and found a different hotel paying for the taxi out of my own pocket a a result of these complication i arrived in s o paulo more than hour late despite my effort to assert my right and seek reimbursement for the taxi ba s customer service ha been extremely poor their phone line are non functional email are only answered automatically and the appropriate channel for such request have not been responsive since the first week of march this experience ha left me extremely disappointed especially considering the high standard of service i once associated with ba,negative
the worst customer experience british airway ba is effectively robbing people they are not here to help and show no compassion my partner and i fell ill and had a doctor s note stating we couldn t fly ba said they d hold our flight amount a a voucher valid for a year fair enough caveat to this which wa not stated to u you must call them and it is not usable on holiday package however using this voucher wa a nightmare we can t use it for both our ticket because the original wa long haul and they refuse to refund half the amount ba s customer service wa awful and rude effectively stealing from u this policy must stop we feel held hostage with no solution,negative
had to cancel my flight month in advance due to a change of schedule i wa flying with american airline and british airway selected seat and when i attempted to get a refund on the selected seat aa refunded me with no issue when ba refused despite both company having similar policy avoid them fly with anyone else customer service is a joke taking over week to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what i wa told on the phone,negative
flight cancelled with no reason given less than h before departure the earliest offered replacement on their terrible to use app wa day later which wa unacceptable their phone line do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface overall terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service,negative
this is a route i fly regularly used first class security and lounge all good lounge surprisingly not so busy wa great to see we weren t departing from the dreaded a bus gate and the flight wa on time boarded and ready to go on time and then six passenger were a no show a minute delay to offload the bag and depart longer than the actual flight itself there ha to be a better process for fast tracking this hence finally arrived in paris min late on the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these day,positive
while ba may have made some positive improvement to it club world product it world traveler product and catering leaf much to be desired the first meal service wa very slow more than hour to serve the meal the portion were incredibly small the chicken dish contained maybe piece of chicken piece of broccoli and a piece of unknown food small snack were available during the flight but the real let down wa the snack before landing in vancouver it wa a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap which didn t have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry it wa too sweet too mushy and too salty the seat although not exactly spacious were tolerable although the aisle are very narrow and cabin crew and other passenger frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisle cabin crew were generally responsive to passenger request and once or twice during the flight came down the aisle with drink however the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip i certainly cannot recommend ba,positive
british airway new club suite is a marked improvement from their older club world seat the new club suite offer a fair amount of privacy especially with the screen door closed and includes direct aisle access when fully reclined the seat convert into a fairly spacious bed although i found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on the catering on board wa fairly good and tasty the appetizer and the main course were generally well cooked although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service it took almost hour after departure from vancouver for the meal service to be completed prior to arrival a light breakfast wa served which contained a croissant a small egg and bacon sandwich and a mango puree ba s catering on this flight wa generally good unfortunately upon arrival at heathrow passenger had to wait over minute for checked baggage to arrive no explanation wa given and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passenger or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive this wa a very frustrating end to what wa otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in club world and left a very poor last impression of ba,positive
four very pleasant on time flight with friendly helpful staff the guy on the lhr sfo leg wa exceptional and i regret that i have forgotten his name only negative wa the food on the sfo lhr leg the advertised filet steak wa more akin to stewing steak and wa inedible sadly this is not the only occasion i have food on u uk flight to be sub standard otherwise happy to recommend ba,positive
we travel extensively over year and tend to use ba on our regular trip where possible and in recent year we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delay operational issue flight cancellation poor check in experience etc on our last two recent trip one to zurich and another to iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing a on time and no problem being reported we have just returned from iceland and our experience wa one of the worst we have ever had with ba again our flight wa just cancelled due to operational reason but what made matter worse on this occasion wa the flight wa quite early at am we went to bed at around pm night before checked the flight and it showed a being on time with again no issue being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine we woke up at am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning we were then left with virtually no other return flight option for that day it soon got worse a the earliest flight option then being offered by ba wa day later we opted to choose tuesday with ba a we were left with no other option if we hadn t acted quickly the tuesday availability wa sure to sell out leaving u with a return option of wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with ba in zurich back in december we were lucky on this occasion a ba offered several flight back on the same day in zurich but this wasn t the case with iceland we were then left in a right predicament a hotel availability in iceland wa very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight our hotel wa fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport from a logistical point of view this wa a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotel we then decided to search for any in direct flight online to get u back to the uk sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in direct flight into gatwick with norwegian air but it went via oslo and a total journey time of hour this wa not ideal a our car wa in heathrow assessing our option which were virtually none we had no guarantee that the flight with ba on tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with norwegian air both flight were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of if we had stayed in iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with ba or the insurance company our priority wa to return home asap a we had important work and personal commitment on the monday so we had to return asap we eventually flew back fine with norwegian air and the service we received wa far superior to that of ba the boarding process wa slick on both flight compared to a complete shamble with ba norwegian air offered a full food trolley service with soft drink tea s and also a range of alcoholic drink compare this to just the water and snack bar on ba both flight were on time and we eventually landed in gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time we got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at gatwick and in the morning we contacted ba to cancel our alternative tuesday flight,negative
flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around jfk however this wa made up during the flight only to be delayed again by weather over lhr spending an extra hour in the american ba lounge at jfk wa not ideal cold environment cold staff indifferent to the traveller need one area wa exceptionally dirty with plate on the table and napkin strewn on the floor waited for a drink a no one to serve played a game of find the chip crisp which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the area this is a crazy expensive route in business class and it feel like a rip off across all the airline however the quality of ba s business class ha much improved with the introduction of the suite the privacy is a big improvement a too is the seat comfort and i managed a good hr sleep on the overnight red eye flight food service wa very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight wa the flight attendant unfortunately i didn t catch his name but he wa superb being responsive to the few request i made and remembered my name throughout the flight a small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendant on ba very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating,positive
a very full flight made premium economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough catering wa pretty good and the inflight service wa efficient and friendly arrived on time and no delay with baggage delivery no complaint a pe served it s function for the relatively short hr flight,positive

i am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight european business class is typically x seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty leg room is never generous and ba is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect however on this occasion at least and a the flight is one hour that wa not an issue cabin crew were great very professional and efficient cabin wa clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date i wa surprised to find that business class wa served an afternoon tea complete with champagne much nicer than the poor prosecco in the lounge we had three small sandwich chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them it all tasted great i didn t try the chocolate cake and there wa just about enough time to eat it before landing the crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them,positive

i strongly advise everyone to never fly british airway i know we will never do so again we had business class seat booked for an early morning flight from heathrow to sf and then the flight wa cancelled the evening before the flight we luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it wa canceled we then called ba and after waiting minute someone to answer the call the person who finally did said he wa going to move u to a united air flight leaving an hour later from heathrow to sf the next day he told u the flight number and said he had booked u business class seat it took a long time to get it all worked out so we got just a few hour sleep that night but it looked like it wa resolved then however when we got to heathrow early the next morning we found that the ba person did not complete the booking a needed and united could not give u seat they said we needed to call ba to get them to complete the change but despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at ba this went on for hour finally by the grace of god after hour of stress trying to figure out what to do we found a united ticket agent at the airport who personally called ba for u and got then to fix the problem so after being at heathrow at am we ended up leaving for sf late that afternoon totally exhausted the united air ticket agent saved u and allows u to get home she also said these problem were common with ba,positive

we had a premium economy return flight los angeles to london the outbound flight wa cancelled with under hour notice and we had to instead take an economy flight via dublin to london that s annoying but it happens what is really difficult to understand is ba s response since i raised this a a claim once our return flight had completed a i wa instructed to do it is now nearly month and there ha been no response other than one in early march with the title we ve not forgotten your case and we re really sorry you re still waiting for a response from u we know it s been a long time since you contacted u and this isn t the service you should expect rest assured we ve not forgotten your case our customer relation team are working extremely hard to respond to you a soon a possible thank you for your continued patience you can check the status of your case here please accept our most sincere apology we look forward to speaking with you soon i called about a month ago to enquire and wa told i d be hearing within the week this is just extremely poor customer service in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late cancelled flight delay and change in class of flight british airway really seems to be on the decline i have so many friend who are long time customer like u who are having flight cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right i have been a member of their flying club for year is this how you treat loyal customer ba,positive
i should like to review my flight with british airway from hannover to london heathrow firstly the website wa very easy to use however i object to the policy put in place with regard to having to pay for preferred seating checking in online wa a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat at the boarding gate in hannover the staff were superb they insisted that people with larger bag turned over the bag for check in i wa included in this the staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner the flight took off reasonably on time the cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what wa an entirely full flight the now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a uk p coin were issued to the passenger on this flight the captain wa very vocal in the nicest possible way he oozed a sense of professionalism and wa well spoken with clear and informative announcement disembarkation wa orderly however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft given that this wa a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism this experience ha turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few month ago well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey,positive
we have flown with british airway a few time but this last trip wa by far the worst experience we weren t able to check in online because the system wouldn t accept any of our passport info so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport we arrived two hour before our scheduled departure the line wa backed up with only station being staffed where there wa room for at least more attendant to help expedite check in we talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online it took the desk attendant an hour to check in the people ahead of u we told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn t accept our passport she replied it wa because they need to verify each passport personally i asked that wouldn t they verify them that way anyway i also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seat available but couldn t secure them because we couldn t finish check in she went on to tell u it s a full flight so we wouldn t be able to choose our seat we reached the gate and ask the agent there about moving to another section and she confirmed there wa no availability during the flight the service wa not what we expected based on previous flight we only saw the flight attendant during food service and twice to pickup trash every time i went to the lavatory there were at least attendant standing around chatting instead of taking care of the passenger the attendant seemed uninterested and inexperienced even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt the flight attendant were disappointing to say the least no available air control vent above u so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had upon landing we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bag an hour later still no bag finally a message came over the loudspeaker that the elevator on the plane wa broken and the eta of the bag wa still unknown about minute later the bag started to slowly appear on the belt overall this wa the worst ba flight we ve experienced,negative
i sat in the plane at vienna airport for three hour and didn t take off after arriving in london i wa sent on my connecting flight only to be told that the plane had already closed and that i should go back to the other terminal i wa then flown to johannesburg with virgin and when i arrived my luggage had not been taken i only received it five day later i have been waiting for compensation for nine month never again british airway,negative
it is almost pm we were supposed to take off at we are still sitting on the plane at the airport the worst part is not the technical issue that ha kept u grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board being hungry and dehydrated ha not helped the situation,positive
i booked a long haul flight to singapore with british airway because i thought i could rely on them to provide good and reliable service unfortunately this wasn t the case hence this review knowing i would be able to fall asleep watching movie or tv show on their in flight entertainment system wa something i wa looking forward to on this overnight flight however my console didn t work and instead i had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some baby in front only two hour into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the wifi pas for which we will get fully reimbursed i followed up several time throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement this wasn t the case after waiting for several day i contacted them myself and instead of the reimbursement that i can use towards a nice meal on holiday they ve given me avios i never want to fly with them again so why give me service point when i wa told by cabin crew i would be refunded the only reason i even bought this wifi pas a it s not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor what a waste of a flight and these are hr of my life i will never get back and forever remember i will remember ba a the brand that once wa that no longer is their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came if you can avoid booking with ba go ahead,negative
a premium price for a sub par product flew ba lhr and hkg and return in may we had originally booked when the aircraft wa allocated the club suite paid for seat selection a couple of month prior to the trip the aircraft wa changed to the layout with the yin yang seat configuration we had been allocated of the middle seat so paid again to select the window and aisle the hard product is poor the seat space lack any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position nowhere to put spec a book or phone additionally the window seat passenger ha to climb over the foot of another passenger to use the toilet etc really poor layout the plane on both leg of the journey were tired and shabby the crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service the outbound catering wa acceptable but the presentation on tiny plate doe not compare favourably with competitor the catering inbound wa very poor the welcome champagne wa truly awful this is a poor product at a premium price and sad to say this pair of self funding passenger won t choose to repeat the experience the lounge at heathrow on the outbound sector wa packed to the rafter and wa a poor experience very disappointing,negative
really terrible user experience british airway website is full of glitch i can t even choose my own seat due to cookie problem never had this problem with any other airline,negative
very impressed with ba check in online wa a little convoluted but once through that everything wa great we flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seat this seems to be standard for all airline now and how they keep initial price down but worth doing so we could sit together meal were excellent and drink great a simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then drink main meal and snack on our hour leg wa better than our last trip on emirate they gave out double drink at drink service that wa coke and beer for my partner and he wa well pleased staff friendly bag transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route wa good too will definitely choose ba again over other airline,positive
lhr sfo la lgw august in club world it s a shame that the british airway experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew and dated product and dreadful after service our flight to san francisco wa on an a the interior of which wa showing it s age two of our seat had issue would not recline the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other wa temperamental with it s recline and the ife would not respond to the control crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded year ago a shame for such a great aircraft coming back from la vega to lgw on an tired we were informed at check in that there wa an issue with the seat we had pre booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved seat we were moved to were fine and worked the original seat had people in them and they appeared fine flight wa late landing and departing due to weather condition in vega but the aircraft wa turned round in a super quick time which wa impressive where ba have really let themselves down is the after flight experience after month we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issue on the flight to sfo we are still waiting month later for the avios point we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the la vega to london gatwick leg of the flight despite numerous attempt to contact they haven t got back to u our avios account page through ba won t load our recent transaction and doe not list the flight we ve taken in the last month won t be travelling with ba for a long long time now dated and poorly maintained on board product and appalling customer service,positive
i flew from malaga via lhr to boston on the th may and on arrival in boston discovered my luggage wa still in london filed a report and now day later no sign of the luggage the baggage customer service is a joke not interested in the client or giving a good service update are useless i know my luggage ha been sitting in boston since the th a i have an air tag inside it the airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me the robot on fb messenger twitter are useless i opened a complaint when i checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human this airline is now a joke and if i ever get my luggage back i doubt i will ever fly with them again they are now worse than air canada in my book and that is saying something,negative
milan to miami return via london worst business class ever the layout of a of ba is crazy the width of seat is outrageous aisle seat are a shame for ba length is ok but you have to jump over the leg of another passenger when he she is in sleeping mode unbelievable the system of divider up and down to reach all seat by crew is absurd and awful never again with this layout meal wa below average from lhr to mia while the return wa quite good unfortunately for ba i flew in march with qatar airway business class and not comparable just to highlight the difference ba row ha seat while qr ha seat that s it on top of that the service is quite strange mainly due to divider above boarding procedure look well organized at the beginning then during boarding become quite messy,negative
ba created a new low cost subsidiary in ba euroflyer for flight out of london gatwick from a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from ba mainline short haul out of heathrow however it is most definitely inferior firstly is the seat ba promised to keep their old much more comfortable pinnacle seat up to row in their refurbishment of these plane with slimline seat however at ba euroflyer it seems the whole plane ha these installed on some plane despite snagging a seat in row we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seat that have no lumbar support and no headrest one positive of the new seat wa meant to be at seat power to charge device but this didn t have that either the onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of harrogate spa water what we got wa horrible nairn s raisin oat biscuit without asking if we d like the other choice and no water on the return flight it wa explicitly announced we d be offered a glass of water for free but this wa not offered during the service the snack wa sole choice of a pack of mcvities milk chocolate digestive hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offering we ve received when flying from heathrow on the way back we did have non refurbished plane with pinnacle seat this wa welcome however clearly the plane is not maintained a one toilet had no water flowing from the tap very irritating when you soap up to wash your hand after going to the toilet i went to rinse my hand in the other toilet luckily it wasn t busy the tap wa working but the sink wasn t draining and almost overflowed lastly the cabin crew on ba euroflyer are very unpolished look miserable and extremely demotivated a lot of them a very young we re talking late teen and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the condition offered to them ba really need to rethink it product offering in short haul ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reason but invariably there is a reason like u they don t fly with their low cost rival because they want peace of mind less stress and to be comfortable so replicating the like of ryanair easyjet or wizz air is just alienating a a customer because we choose ba to avoid the kind of experience they offer we were on an award ticket but looking at cash ticket they re not even cheap nor offer better timing than those rival despite all this bean counting,positive
i flew with british airway from heathrow to hannover although the check in process wa relatively quick there wa a noticeable lack of staff another apparent cost cutting measure by ba upon arriving in hannover i found that my luggage hadn t made it to the airport and there were no staff to assist i had to file a report online the following day i received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight but this didn t help me since german shop are closed on sunday leaving me without essential item a a result i wa confined to my hotel unable to attend any planned event because i didn t have suitable clothing when my luggage eventually reached the hannover airport i got a call from ba informing me that they couldn t deliver it for another day or two they advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said i could claim back the cost but when i submitted my claim ba refused to cover the taxi expense they also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage even though it disrupted a full day of my trip service on my return flight from frankfurt wa also below par from the ground crew at frankfurt airport who were slow rude at check in ba s customer service ha declined significantly now resembling the level of budget airline like easyjet and ryanair but at a premium price given my recent experience i will avoid flying with ba whenever possible,negative
manchester to copenhagen via london on th april aircraft were a and a respectively both in decent condition i arrived from africa and had to transit and change terminal to t which is very cumbersome and tedious check in wa quick easy and professional got my desired seat due to silver status at ba from t i had to go through one of the worst security check ever encountered fragmenting almost every item in my carry ons their escape lounge in t is quite decent particular beer choice and prosecco sparkling wine food wa very poor neither any savoury snack nor meaty food at all good tarmac view first flight wa delayed forcing me to catch the nd in lhr within hour however i wa informed clearly at gate upon arriving in lhr assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot onboard only a mini bottle of water and some bagged crumb were given fairly useless and superfluous no ife or wifi annoying charity begging from fa on both flight are intrusive annoying disrespectful and degrades the airline offering onboard like discount carrier except being pricier arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage,negative
i have never seen such disrespect to a customer it wa the rd time in month that i wa unable to do a check in because of their website not working properly lost hour on the phone with their customer service team at the airport i wa asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin i could not recline my seat and the staff wa rude and unhelpful to me the wifi wa also not working i made multiple complaint and no one ever even contacted me never using them again,negative
paid for a hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in flight entertainment system ended up in a seat where the in flight entertainment system wa malfunctioning and could not be used at all flight attendant sought to perform a service recovery through their customer relation team contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an evoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight ticket with ba explained to them that i had no intention of travelling again within the next two year so i had no use of an evoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead something that could really be useful instead customer relation simply brushed my request off a them unable to offer any alternate gesture of goodwill compensation in british airway is a matter of goodwill pay for a ticket but don t get what you paid for in full compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline so that they can disappoint you further an ultimately self serving inconsiderate undiscerning and insincere compensation which in itself isn t even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about because any compensation is a gesture of goodwill something you don t deserve in their view,negative
very inconsiderate pa announcement were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at ba for comedy club acting although not at the right setting first pre landing pa my colleague and i had a very long week with british airway so we are dimming the light a we don t want you to see our face if you are afraid of the dark just look at the passenger next to you although clearly not the purser s intent it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero darkness phobia who may have a panic attack after such a joke very inconsiderate and damage ba s brand a a safe accessible and a trusted airline second pa after landing wa if you d like to make a complaint go call easyjet i felt genuinely insulted by this joke ba charged an abusive fee in the end i literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because i recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk instant noodle which i purchased onboard were barely edible all cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me a a nuisance even when i just wanted to pas through them to visit the lavatory and then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else wake up ba you are already worse than easyjet and ryanair in term of value for money i note that only one who found the purser s joke funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laugh while passenger remained dead silent i can understand airline scaling back service to cut cost i will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passenger i am a ba silver member and have been a loyal ba customer for year a disgrace,negative
absolutely terrible lost my luggage on both flight delivered day later smashed to piece a lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight yielding a hour delay the aircraft wa oversubscribed dirty with an unpleasant persistent odour food wa genuinely horrible i m ex force i ll eat almost anything usually,negative
we booked premium economy round trip from phoenix to zurich via aa codeshare and operated by british airway on our way return flight back to phoenix february th the first leg of the ba flight between zurich and london heathrow wa delayed departure which cause u missed the ba connection flight between heathrow and phoenix first problem is that when we dash to the terminal security check point at pm the airplane wa still at gate and will not depart until pm if it will be on schedule we had almost min at that point however the terminal security stopped u and wa told we cannot pas thru the security due to airline requirement we later realized that flight did not leave until pm we were directed to the customer service to re book the flight when we got to ba customer service transfer counter there wa only one agent available there were least passenger waiting in the line we were told ba wa short of staff due to british holiday during end of february and there wa a soccer championship match that sunday so it took u at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to phoenix on different flight on the same day then the agent who re booked the flight told u his printer wa broken and we need go to zone of terminal to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed we found zone and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with u a well we also told there wa a shuttle bus around the corner to take u to the hotel however no map or detail direction provided it took u a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired next day we arrived at airport few hour ahead our scheduled departed time pm i noticed my checked two bag not in the same spot based on my iphone s find me feature i had apple air tag in each of my checked bag so i checked with the gate agent she confirmed with me that only one checked bag wa associated with my flight luckily the flight wa delayed two hour so my other bag made to the same flight while on the flight the team of young flight attendant were generally pleasant but they missed to service me meal i did not order any special meal and the popular chicken dish wa not available when she came to my row so i told her any chicken dish will be ok and she told me give her few minute and she will bring me a different chicken dish however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash i mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish she wa surprised and acting like i wa lying to her overall i think my premium economy flight on ba is the worst experience in recent memory a the british flagship carrier they seem don t care i emailed my sent my experience to their customer service they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email template,positive
we chose rotterdam and london city airport because of convenience both small and having a hotel in the docklands meant a short distance from city airport three hour before our departure our flight wa canceled however disappointing but we made a swift move to amsterdam schiphol airport but unfortunately we were offered a flight to heathrow which meant almost hour by tube to our hotel flight back operated out of lcy to rtm but had a min delay so in term of punctuality ba is not very reliant the flight were okay with a snack and a drink the e being far more comfortable with seating and more legroom than the a our extra expense for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back so ba did a good job in this respect but hesitant to book again though they are the only airline flying between rtm and lcy,positive
the entire booking and ticketing experience ha been stressful and erroneous i booked directly with ba a i thought why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is uk and i need to go to the uk mistake this wa month ago i could not cancel or change my flight without paying them to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just year on account otherwise all wa lost minus a few hundred in tax a whom i am really flying with is american airline and another partner i can t check in without being redirected then those site don t recognize me i don t appear in aa or aer lingus application i couldn t ask for more time to change plane in london despite all review saying how long and hard it is a that would mean a cancel of plane ticket loss of all money i ve been on the phone with agent for over an hour on different call their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode a minute wait for the email and then i get the same error,negative
british airway cancelled my flight less than hour before automatically rebooked it for day later i called customer service time trying to change it and they would not help my daughter wa flying on a different reservation and because i am legally blind i needed to be on the same flight they didn t care nor would they help we eventually bought new ticket on easyjet when we arrive home i entered a complaint to get my fare refunded it took them month and then the response wa it wa cancelled because of a strike in spain so they won t refund it easyjet didn t cancel the whole experience wa awful and so disappointing,negative
i wanted to write this review so i could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on lisbon named jay ramphul she went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation i had boarded my flight with minute before take off when i realized i had left my cell phone in the club lounge i wa not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off jay stepped in and made it happened she literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minute of take off this is true service i don t know if this review will ever get back to her or her management but i hope it doe i want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter,positive
check in fast and friendly security a breeze lounge wa busy early evening but comfortable and clean flight attendant welcoming seat a nightmare it wa the reverse forward with a step over from the window seat who the hell thought that wa a good idea meal were ok but all curry based like curry and i wa on a flight to india so fa wa brilliant a the only flyer awake on an overnight flight improving since my last ba flight,positive
this is the first time i have seen the new club world suite the seat wa comfortable but unlike other airline ba ha crammed a many seat in business class a is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped the crew behaved a though we the passenger should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift they looked scruffy in the new uniform clearly the dress code policy ha been scrapped i appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality in the uk alone but the service wa appalling the menu lacked choice and the food wa presented a if it fell to the floor and wa scooped back onto the plate the bedding wa atrocious an old scraggly blanket and i ll fitting seat cover i wa cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived there were no drink coaster obviously cutback so my drink kept spilling i decided to clean up myself a the crew couldn t be bothered and didn t pick up on the fact i wa using bathroom hand towel to act a drink coaster to mop up the mess the aircraft wa old although retrofitted and had a leak by the galley wall with lot of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess not at all a premium service this felt more like a low cost carrier doing business,positive
flew business class from doha to london on st march the service wa slow and unfriendly even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who wa looking after the area where i wa in to smile i ordered waffle for breakfast and they looked like they d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on see photo the plate that the waffle were served on wa so hot that when i moved the plate i burnt my finger i wasn t warned that it wa ferociously hot i wa shocked at how bad the food presentation wa but didn t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew a she wasn t approachable or friendly for lunch the bread roll wa so dry and rock hard that i couldn t cut through the end not sure why the food and service wa so bad on this flight a generally ba food is good and is well presented also the wi fi wasn t working on the flight,positive
starting off at heathrow terminal check in wa fairly easy but fast track security wa terrible the area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machine in the fast track area and at this time only one wa in use so the queue wa long and very slow moving i ve heard mixed thing about the ba club lounge but i wa fairly impressed food option were fairly varied and tasted really nice nice salad a well a pie and veg drink a always in ba lounge are very easy to lay your hand on and cater for most want lounge wa a decent size with various seating option and wasn t very busy at the time i went sunday evening boarding wa well organised and club passenger higher tier wa boarded quickly and easily amenity kit bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat welcome drink were provided fairly quickly after sitting down hot towel provided after take off shortly followed by drink and nut a ha been regularly said these nut would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which wa served hr after take off then a breakfast meal before landing both meal were genuinely delicious all meat were tender and juicy and very wa perfectly cooked drink were provided whenever asked although crew were too busy serving all passenger to proactively offer top ups breakfast wa offered to passenger a they woke up which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order almost but not quite like a la carte dining crew were friendly and efficient with some nice personality coming through this is fairly standard of my experience with ba in flight entertainment wa excellent good screen quality responsive touch screen excellent selection i did not use the wifi however it wa available on this aircraft and price are reasonable i think the seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartment are convenient and spacious enough the crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the door so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed the reverse herringbone layout doe make the footwell a bit cramped and also mean it s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other facing away from the door i did manage a few hour of sleep though so not too bad overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding it own a a decent business class product service,positive
we have flown this route with easyjet regularly for more than twenty year but at the age of boarding at nice ha become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if ba wa better the outward flight from heathrow wa not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking at the time l booked l wa recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake after considerable panic l booked last minute flight at considerable cost with easyjet boarding being the usual shamble flying into gatwick rather than heathrow the only way to get home wa a taxi rather than a bus fare from heathrow on arrival home l discovered that i did have an email confirmation of the return flight from ba so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation in the two week since they have sent two apology for their slow response but nothing else so far we have elderly friend who say that they now find travelling with british airway so stressful that they will not travel outside the uk again this will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the uk ha deteriorated to this extent unfortunately jal or singapore both of which l have used happily over many year do not fly within europe,negative
a last minute business trip to hnd a route i regularly fly overall a good experience in the new club world offering which personally i like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight i arrived lhr in plenty of time and used the first class wing a i am eligible due to exec club status great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new no need to empty your bag scanner additionally the first class lounge wa not a busy a usual so a nice experience boarding wa from gate a by bus probably the least enjoyable part of the journey it s not uncommon for this flight to use a which baffle me a such a large number of passenger need to take the not so scenic journey past all the a gate b gate and finally c gate before arriving at the aircraft even passing a few empty airbridge gate on route boarding wa not well organised with no real announcement they started checking in people bag and pre boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it wa general boarding and started moving forward group wa then opened before i got to the front on the queue group began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the bus so not enough room once onboard the aircraft wa clean and i like the ife offering in the new club world unfortunately i didn t find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging i know it a lot of passenger and a long flight but there wa not much smiling or customer service at one point i had to walk through the galley to the toilet on return crew member were talking one in particular wa blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn t offer to et me past eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so i can pas on another occasion i went to request a drink and wa effectively scowled at in a look that felt like what do you want and why are you disturbing me other than those point a generally good flight and on time arrival to hnd,positive
overall i would say disappointing due to ba status i had lounge access on the small side and very busy the aircraft used a remote gate boarding wa not well organised by group status a it should be but i did manage to make my way onto the first bus of on arrival at the aircraft the plane wa still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus after minute or so everyone wa becoming a little irritable a it turn out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passenger that needed assistance which wa delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive after minute waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft the captain apologised for the delay no mention from the crew seat wa standard euro traveller the service wa okay but the crew were not particularly engaging when i tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on a a result of some minor turbulence i wa told it wouldn t be possible a the crew member reached two row behind be the seatbelt sign wa turned off but they didn t come back to ask if i would still like a coffee overall we arrived into lhr hour late no tug to move the aircraft in lisbon and had to wait for the gate in lhr disappointing but not the worst flight i have had,negative
lhr to delhi in business exceptional flight stylish and quirky b gate lounge with interesting modern and eclectic food plus whispering angel bar food on board wa delicious and well presented friendly fun relaxed crew with a blend of deference self deprecation and over familiarity been flying ba for year in various class and this wa probably the best great job ba,positive
efficient and smooth flight from start to finish cabin crew attentive and bubbly very clean aircraft mcvities snack a nice touch and even the coffee in a bag wa unexpectedly nice everything to praise and nothing to complain about,positive
wa told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane a all overhead cabin were already full so had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door frustrating a we had just hand luggage to avoid delay at heathrow then the bag did not arrive at the baggage belt and after min waiting had to spend another min filling in form etc wa told the bag are still in madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform u before we waited for them to arrive hour later no communication from ba such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by ba there were many people who had bag that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabin were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing u of the fact they did not leave madrid is a double level of incompetence,negative
the flight wa comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg however on both leg i wa told i had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold a the flight wa full having done so i wa not amused to see other passenger bringing much larger case into the cabin ba should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply,negative
we had a really good flying experience with ba travelling a a young family of the flight left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flight food wa generous and quite tasty for economy class with the crew coming around with water drink throughout the flight our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at vce and our return flight to yul on all of our flight the crew were attentive friendly and helpful with u and our child especially the gentleman who served u on the return flight from vce to yul on march th the b interior is really dated and really need to be updated to compete with their european counterpart there were panel squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence seat cover coming off the seat and tray table which were not level and loose for eating the ife on the b worked fine but it definitely wasn t a responsive and did not have a newer larger screen like the one on the b thankfully the b have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatory which created problem for passenger unfortunately on nearly all of our flight there wa garbage left in the seat pocket and the floor weren t quite a clean on the incoming flight to lhr the b wa not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport which resulted in significant delay for the airport bus to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process we would definitely consider flying trans atlantic with ba again a we received value and service for the fare we paid,positive
waited an hour to check in at the paphos business check in staff utterly incompetent flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bin without my consent to make way for another customer luggage i wa then coerced to have my luggage at my foot throughout my flight utterly outrageous last thing you would expect in ba business class,negative
not a great experience at all from the outset it wa poorly managed a they bused u out to a parking slot only to have u wait for minute in the bus a the plane wa ready ba business class is not business class tired small and generally not worth the ticket price table that don t sit straight arm rest that aren t secure and terrible screen it s not a patch on first class airline which is apparently where ba think they should be they have a long way to go,positive
boarding wa difficult caused by vast majority of the passenger carrying too much hand luggage fa s were friendly the seat on ba for european flight are extremely narrow there wa a choice of breakfast and very surprising the champagne castelau on european flight is of a better quality a the brand used in club on intercontinental flight nothing wrong with this flight however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seat waiting time at brussels for luggage some minute what is very acceptable,positive
boarding started with a delay of some minute everybody could see member of the team only did arrive en minute before the announced boarding time we had to wait outside for nearly minute it wa hot unfortunately flying from barbados to london in club class wa an underwhelming experience ba is not performing a great performance on international flight anymore lucky the had the new configuration a welcome aboard champagne or fruit juice the glass were filled at the level of one inch a far cheaper brand of champagne heidsieck monopole and no more ro champagne available wine also poor there wa no french wine cognac is also not available anymore my meal wa sub par the steak wa replaced by beef stew and the fa made it very clear dessert or cheese not both after some hour flight there wa no more ice available minimal information from the flight deck breakfast not suitable at all for a business class some of the fa were friendly others not at all far from pleasant experience despite the high fare,positive
absolutely horrible customer service will never fly again we left toronto for london and then missed our connecting flight from london to mumbai so we had to book with a different airline and pay the cost they then cancelled our return flight week later from mumbai to toronto without notifying u we just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of we are now stuck in mumbai with small kid no return flight first and last time flying with them,negative
ba is not what it used to be a much a i like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety at no point did he make eye contact or ask security question and counter opened minute late crew from cph wa wonderful but announcement were too loud and too many maybe i wa just grumpy took less than to get out of lhr through self service and transfer to lgw wa a breeze crew on the po sector wa ok had an aisle seat and wa bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for hour not her fault but could never relax fully one caribbean crew excelled and joined the carnival spirit most passenger were feeling onboard i wonder if ba management ever tasted the food onboard absolutely tasteless and some of the worst i saved choosing ba over klm which wa the only reason i chose them klm is definitely a league over ba in many aspect and no need to change airport,positive
ba first it s not even the best business class in the sky cabin very long in the tooth service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drink or dessert nothing just awful value for money,negative
the worst business class experience ground crew in singapore were friendly i ended up switching lounge from ba to qf the aircraft wa late hour the cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew i have experienced no one smiled not welcomed on board no body wa checking though out the flight if i wanted anything i found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment nobody came a stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he d been offer a refreshment he said no i looked at her and made eye contact she looked at me and walked straight past observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the lady struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead during the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work when disembarking walked past crew not one wa saying goodbye and thank you to any passenger the food i had wa average i had a cocktail it wa ok the wine selection wa below average,negative
quite possibly the worst business class i have ever flown in it barely rate a premium economy and ba shouldn t be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional route in europe on these route ba ha crammed their seat so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline buyer beware there is no point in upgrading to business class other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first the seat are extremely uncomfortable and they can t really be reclined there is no in flight entertainment not even an app which many discount airline do use for regional flight once upon a time ba used to be a good airline and maybe it still is for long haul but it s truly awful for short haul and is a five hour flight actually short haul might a well save some money and just book a cheaper airline staff are courteous and professional the issue is the quality of the product for the price,positive
i will never be flying with ba again this is my first and last i wa flying from singapore transit at sydney and then to auckland my destination firstly there wa an hour delay for the flight from singapore that wa fine i received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later i confirmed with the staff at singapore that i ll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it wa just an hour delay v a few hour in transit i arrived in sydney the flight wa fine and the ba staff were decent i knew that it wa close to my boarding time and so i rushed through the check to get to my international transit flight we were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus after queuing for such a long time they scanned my boarding pas and said that i wa taken off this flight i wa not notified prior and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re book of my connecting flight i rushed over a quickly a i could to waste no time the lady who wa a qantas rep told me that i needed to speak to a menzies rep about this matter she gave me instruction to find a menzies rep i rushed to the boarding gate of an asiana flight to speak to a menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passenger so i waited by the side for all the passenger to board only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re book my connecting flight there were other disgruntled passenger when i arrived the next available flight wa at night this meant that i arrived at am at sydney and had to wait for close to hour to get on the next flight a i did not have an aussie visa did not need one a per my booked flight i wa not granted a day stay and wa given a meal voucher and wa sent off to hunt for a good place to rest sleep nap many cafe and restaurant rejected my meal voucher by the way but i finally got food ultimately my re booked flight wa delayed again by another min the stress anxiety fatigue and hassle caused by ba s poor re booking system i ve filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we re waiting to hear back,negative
on the my trip to mexico city i had the opportunity to experience ba long haul business class for the first time and it wa extremely underwhelming first of all boarding to our flight to mexico city wa done with bus every inch of the bus wa filled with passenger and we couldn t even breath the club world experience is not personalised and it doesn t make you feel special the flight crew were giving the welcome drink a if giving free food at a food bank and i wasn t offered a non alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin the same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant wa serving ice cream mid flight on the way out he literally threw the ice cream to my head a i wa in the middle seat that is covered from all side that make flight attendant hard to reach the most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seat are in they were their old style yin yang seat and they looked pretty old with no storage space and most functionality are working with a struggle my entertainment screen wa not working well and it wa quite unstable when the flight attendant were playing the security on my way out neither of the seat in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendant had to re demonstrate the security instruction manually on the way in the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in when i asked if there is a way to keep the screen open the flight attendant joked saying i will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open i found this attitude unacceptable the screen were old and bad quality i wa quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board they looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served i would not recommend ba business class product based on this experience,positive
i upgraded at check in to club europe seat d and had an excellent experience with ba the check in at the airport wa very quick and smooth with friendly staff once through the fast track i headed for the gallery lounge at lhr t and this exceeded my expectation the food wa really good and i had a superb view out over the runway the flight wa great some people have remarked that legroom isn t good even in club europe but i found it fine for a hour flight afternoon tea wa delicious cabin crew were excellent i wa out the airport in about minute from landing ba did a superb job on this flight,positive
i bought a return trip with ba through webjet australia last year i would fly from sydney to porto middle of june with no problem but i had to return earlier to australia so i requested a change in the date from march to january i should point out that ba partner changed the detail of the return flight many time that is not a problem the problem is that although i wa flexible with the date they refused to fly me back i had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to australia later i asked for a change of the return date to january of next year again that wa turned down i will keep in mind this negative experience with ba when booking future trip,negative
poor from start to finish six month after purchasing our ticket i added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of but this transaction failed to make the system i rang ba customer service only to be cut off without a reply at lhr a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment i wa assured there would be no problem on the return trip wrong same experience at li on board an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault old plane with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free return trip even more uncomfortable seat made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat once upon a time ba stood for something no longer next time it is tap with their much newer plane,negative
communication and customer service non existent they make me pay for seat on my return flight from madrid to london where didn t should be a my ticket wa premium economy on the time of check in just wa able do ba mad but to not mad lhr just in madrid they issued boarding pas changed my seat from f to f worst seat ever explained rudeness on madrid plane changed that section is business and you are premium only we send you to the back no apology no answer complaint low cost airline treat you better refund of seat received but zero apology,negative
that wa supposed to be my flight but it wa cancelled hour before takeoff after nearly month ba finally responded to my compensation claim confirming i wa due statutory compensation another month later and still not received it despite chasing according to ba my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again from my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carrier,negative
have no fear when your ba flight is operated by finnair the business class seat offer more leg room than the ba offering and the service just could not have been better food ba wa good too excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there wa a delay disembarking a there wa no one available at lhr to pilot the bridge,negative
we have flown ba five time from western usa to england always decent service never again if you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate it s terrible take you in endless repeating circle and loop that never lead to any resolution they lost our suitcase we spent hour upon our arrival in lisbon trying to navigate their website it wa frustrating and fruitless three day into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletry and electronics can we talk to a real person no it s impossible we have even quit thinking about the we spent to secure seat in economy that turned out to have no extra legroom we paid extra for nothing we are done with ba whoop not quite we still have to get home,negative
london heathrow to istanbul at the start of the half term school holiday and so the flight wa very busy indeed boarding wa quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agent one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issue i felt singled out by a member of the ba crew who insisted that my small bag wa taken and checked in other passenger had large bag and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight during the flight i felt that a staff member wa very unprofessional towards me i had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin i may a well have been invisible the same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drink and snack from business class for his compatriot he managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me the a wa clean no ife and not even a route map to follow the journey it wa a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic i received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuit the wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop wa not accessible either i asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me is this how low ba ha fallen i also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and of his colleague this is not good enough disembarkation wa remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passenger during the flight with sensible update,positive
jan th i booked a last minute transatlantic flight to ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine so the nature of the trip wa bad enough a it wa it wa not a vacation for me on the transatlantic leg of the flight ba wa the airline it wa a terrible experience a baby wa cry right next to me for a good portion of the flight that s not ba s fault but just to continue to set the stage mid flight they had to close both the bathroom in the middle of the plane i wa in seat j right behind one of the bathroom they both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment i could see the water coming toward me and soon it wa under my foot a you can imagine it didn t smell great it made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boot i contacted ba about this and explained in great detail what had happened their response wa essentially sorry about that i contacted them again to verify that this wa the formal response they responded by offering me a euro voucher to use on a future ba flight which ha very little value to me if any i contacted them again giving them another chance to make it right nothing it s not their fault that there wa a screaming baby nor is it their fault that the restroom overflowed created a disgusting mess and soiled my boot it is their fault that they made no effort to make it right this is not just an inconvenience it s a health and safety issue a far a i can tell i m the only one who got sewage under my foot i think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything i can to avoid flying ba in the future,positive
i am a british airway gold guest list member with lifetime privilege in spite of that i have given up britsh wherever possible i take ten or more trans ocean trip a year i am fortunate to be able to fly first class unfortunately british no longer ha a first class product the sell one by that name at first class price but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good business class experience i should point out that there are airline who sell business class that in fact are better than any british first class experience qatar emirate i have flown many million of mile on british last week i completed an around the world trip on emirate and qantas all a in the million of ba mile i never had an experience a good a what i experience on ek and qantas a very long time ago the food and beverage service on ba wa truly extraordinary today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary so sad a decline seat comfort in first lounge food beverage all need serious rework if you are a first class traveler british is just not an option sad truly sad,positive
another case of reviewing british airway flight that they have not actually provided i booked several month ago for london to casablanca via madrid with the madrid to casablanca leg on iberia returning from marrakech direct on ba first the marrakech flight wa cancelled so i had to rebook on royal air maroc now ba ha changed the london to madrid leg to be operated by iberia so instead of my booking through ba com having out of leg operated by ba i now have none of them being ba flight and they did not transfer my paid for seat selection on london to madrid so i have got to arrange a refund of the payment what is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith only giving out of because i cannot mark it a zero to reflect the zero service received,positive
on the memorable day of january th my family and i embarked on a journey from london heathrow terminal destined for glasgow little did we anticipate the series of event that would unfold shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication a we navigated the bustling corridor of the airport our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle it wa at this juncture that i found myself grappling with booking complication compounded by banking delay amid this quandary i sought assistance from british airway personnel at terminal hoping to salvage our travel plan enter mr sathies a beacon of hope amidst the chaos with a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism mr sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand despite the setback he wasted no time in springing into action exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenge we faced the sequence of event unfolded with remarkable clarity a mr sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholder including senior colleague and his managerial counterpart mr gurvir singh dhillon their collaborative effort culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectation through mr sathies unwavering dedication and mr gurvir singh dhillon s steadfast support our travel arrangement were salvaged without incurring any additional cost despite the initial uncertainty my family and i were able to proceed with our journey embarking on our flight to glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by british airway a i reflect upon the precise sequence of event that transpired on that fateful day i am filled with profound gratitude towards mr sathies mr gurvir singh dhillon and the entire british airway team their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in british airway a a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry,positive
i did not actually get to fly with ba a they cancelled the flight with day notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative resulting in people losing their holiday a river cruise since then a appears to be their standard protocol they have ignored every communication regarding their obligation for compensation and i have no option but to pursue them via official channel,negative
we had possibly the worse check in experience ever this ever it took nearly minute of phone call and numerous staff to check u in for a redemption flight through our account utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we ve done without hitch for the last year once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style club world seat that meaning stepping over your fellow passenger to use the toilet why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated the saving grace a is quite often the case wa some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing i have fed back to ba direct to sing their praise finger crossed for the return leg,positive
i flew to lhr from ath in club europe with ba on dec to transfer to a jal flight back to tokyo at first i had no great expectation of what service i would enjoy on board partly because it flight time wa less than hour and because the seat configuration of club europe wa the typical european business class with the middle seat empty afterward on board remembering that i took the same route with ba more than year ago i got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous service when i asked for a champagne refill a couple of time a benign smile would come to me,positive
i like the british airway world traveller plus product the seat are comfy and the food is good the crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the csm who came round and introduced herself to u and made sure we were comfortable the bar closed half way through the flight to cancun a they can t uplift more alcoholic drink in cancun juice water tea and coffee is available very full flight my only criticism of british airway premium economy is that it feel like they actively try and split family up unless they pay the each to pre book seat the majority of drink are served in plastic not glass there were no inflight snack available on an hour flight it s an upgraded version of economy where a other airline like qantas and singapore airline are business minus still worth the extra though,positive
i have come to boarding and my cabin luggage wa taken because the plane is full i asked to take it to the cabin because i have large notebook and electronics in it but nothing change so now i am sitting in the plane holding notebook and several pack from my luggage and think of how i will stand with all this stuff in my hand in a passport control line in warsaw other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage,positive
stinking nappy being changed in business cabin throughout flight to miami four of u from one family were travelling british airway business i am a british airway gold card member i have been a member of british airway executive club since we only ever fly british airway in first class or business class it ha become a habit to fly ba and we do this because we trust them for safety we have regular long haul flight booked with british airway in both first and business into next year we often fly to the usa both my wife and i used to have virgin atlantic gold card however we sadly returned to ba because virgin did not have a first class seat product even so the service from virgin s gold card department wa off the scale absolutely brilliant and we loved the virgin lounge at heathrow our flight to miami with british airway wa on one of their double decker aircraft these are just too big and i believe contributed to the appalling service perhaps familiarity breed contempt however whether in business or first i now view ba aircraft a just being dirty bus in the sky the food is not much better however our flight wa distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mother of baby changing nappy within the business class cabin instead of doing it where they should be doing it in the wc try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo there must have been three or four baby having nappy changed regularly in our cabin i can put up with the screaming because that can t be helped but not poo cabin crew did nothing about it despite being asked i telephoned ba customer service and ended up speaking to a lady in manchester ba office who told me that she wa ba cabin crew for many year she told me that changing nappy in the cabin should not be allowed that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passenger are trying to enjoy a meal my wife and i are flying first class british airway again to the usa in april and we also have first class ticket to the usa booked for december i sent in a complaint to ba customer relation on behalf of all four member of my family who travelled british airway on december to miami from lhr and had to put up with the disgusting smell which at time were quite dreadful i received a response offering a voucher or avios so given the cost of four business class flight to miami from london british airway value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin at per passenger given that i am a gold card holder an extremely good customer clearly in the top one percent of all ba customer and a gold cardholder if that is how they behave with me god know how they behave with everybody else all i can tell you is that flying with virgin atlantic when i wa a gold member wa highly positive when our child were young we used to fly ba first class at time and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin not in any cabin when i complained to british airway i asked them if changing of nappy in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question i have numerous business class flight booked with ba over the course of the next month a well a first class flight booked,negative

not a great experience i could not check in online a two separate part of the ba computer system do not talk to each other at lhr a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly manually we boarded on time but luggage loading had to be halted a the captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer wa called by the time it wa sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule the flight wa uneventful but the plane had clearly seen better day legroom wa appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the day when flying ba meant something special next time it will be jet,positive

i just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever it really look like british airway customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problem rather than solving them last week we called british airway to make a reservation for the family at the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of mile from american express the representative told u that he could not make the reservation until the mile were in the account and asked u to contact american express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made the conversation wa recorded by british airway and could be checked we immediately called amex within minute and solicited the transfer of k mile amex clearly stated to u whether we were sure a the transfer wa not reversible we said that it wa fine since we had checked previously with british airway we then called british airway immediately to make our reservation to miami they confirmed that the mile arrived to our account but to our surprise they told u that there wa no space not even one seat to miami and that we could not use the mile we explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with mile if we transferred the mile but all this went on deaf ear we called the german office which wa absolutely unhelpful so we also called uk customer service which wa just a unhelpful no manager wa able to open a flight for u with mile and they just kept repeating that this wa not possible even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seat and also seat were available if we would have had gold status in the end british airway took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem did not give u a solution kept our mile and we have to pay for a trip to miami with this service to their customer this is a company that should not be in business every time we call they made u wait for over minute then they answer and put u on hold i have day of waiting and talking with british airway for over hour each day we were on the line for over minute each time we were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone a i wa too long on the phone and she had other customer and we are not customer they never help u,negative

the plane wa extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my child s seat i had to wipe down all the seat after we landed i immediately realized i left my camera with it s bag in the airplane overhead cabin they would not let me back on the plane for security reason so i went to the british airway team on ground they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked now it s been over week with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen i have complained to british airway and all i get is an automated generic response to keep checking with lost property zero customer service for their regular customer and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning very disappointed,negative

my son and i flew to geneva last sunday for a skiing holiday in le arc the flight wa cancelled moment prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hour later that then got delayed by a further three hour they didn t load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passenger who had been on the earlier flight problem happen it s a complex operation what is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem the offshore call centre are unhelpful and obstructive wanting to fob off issue by getting the customer to call special help line that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off the web page are often unable to give information a they are not updated and often refuse to update your input at this time please try again later there is no access to people that are willing to help empowered to help or actually move a situation forward in any way we ve been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half day unable to ski due to our entire wardrobe being in the case the outdated luggage tracking system had the suitacase in geneva day ago where it sat with no one willing to step up and get it delivered what an incredibly heartless and incompetent company,negative
for the price paid bought during a sale it wa a decent experience although the club class business class seat offer no more legroom than economy class using short haul fleet on a hour flight fast track through security wa not honoured the lounge at istanbul airport wa over crowded a it is also open to the public who can pay for usage causing a long queue for entry which wa badly organised boarding wa smooth cabin crew were friendly but their service wa hit and miss eg some people got a welcome and some didn t half of the cabin wa automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half however drink were replenished generously and regularly and the meal wa good with a choice of three main from the menu,positive
flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled thanks to strong tail wind the flight wa full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at heathrow so for and a half hour we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snack nothing at all available to even buy to eat worse than a low cost carrier experience in this sense one of the light panel overhead the seat towards the back of the plan wa broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger s head for the whole flight poor maintenance of cabin i would choose another airline on this route in the future a one of their competitor offer full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin,negative
very poor business class product ba is not even close to the other airline leader which ever way they sell the seat on a it is a layout the cabin feel and is very cramped the food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish however the price of course is at premier level the only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic i felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product would i fly ba business again only if their were no other option and i had no choice,negative
this review is for lhr syd lhr ba and ba business class had a configuration on giving space privacy and easy aisle access seat reclines into comfortable flat bed good quality pillow and duvet privacy with sliding door good storage space around the seat and charging point flight on time no delay gluten free meal were very poor in quality and presentation warm processed meat between two bland slice of gf bread apparently is a business class breakfast on two sector the main course no choice offered wa bland fish which wa served in a single small tray covered with foil in business class condensation had formed a the dish wa reheated probably from chilled so the offering wa sitting in a weak watery liquid one crew member appeared genuinely apologetic a they meekly served one meal do ba also serve the same gf offering in economy economy plus and first on a long haul flight my advice if gf take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of ba for hour my travelling companion had very good regular meal or so they told me with a choice of main course on the same flight crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basic and rather than welcoming and engaging usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered,positive
absolutely pathetic business class product ba is not even remotely competitive with other international airline in the business class market with old outdated across seating no i did not make a typing mistake you either have to climb across someone or someone ha to climb across you to gain aisle access the crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window opening to provide service to passenger in the center seat ba like most other european based airline doe not have a factual intra european business class product even though they promote sell business class intra europe flight feature the same seating throughout the aircraft the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in business class passenger get a meal drink but this doe not justify the higher cost ba s trans atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the narrow across seating the biggest surprise on both the li lhr lhr iah flight wa that ba ha in fact substantially improved their food quality shocking unfortunately it is served in the worst business class configuration of any international airline i have flown the entertainment system small screen my laptop screen is twice the size is like an airline offering decade ago the flight crew wa pleasant perfunctory which is about the best one can expect from a ba crew ba will simply never match the quality of carrier like singapore emirate qatar etihad eva ana japan air new zealand qantas or many others ba can compete with u based airline like delta american united which are also not even in the same universe in term of a high quality business class product one of the biggest slap in the face is that ba expects business class passenger to pay to select seat even though they have paid thousand of dollar to fly business class several hundred u dollar for trans atlantic flight only if you wait until hour before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost certainly another ba management decision that wa made without a functioning brain,positive
overall not bad staff look tired and overworked trying their best weird seat i wa in g going and d going home the button to press for the seat recline are so stiff i had to get help on both flight to get them to work there is another button also very stiff to bring the leg rest out this is an awkward thing which doesn t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your leg but just obstructs your foot really again i had to get help to activate the very stiff button at one point the lady next to me wa pressing the button for me while i tried to recline sit up or put the leg rest back we gave up and called the flight attendant who also had trouble ba please give this some maintenance food only one out of three menu choice available by the time it got to me in premium ec it wa pasta and wa not too bad a christmas turkey dinner wa offered but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available minute into the meal service breakfast wa an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube it wa disgusting same offered on return journey a cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer the tea and coffee wa hot at least overall i would say air canada provides a much superior premium ec service than ba i won t choose ba again,positive
this wa our first flight with british airway in over year and a usual i couldn t fault them a we were connecting we had little interaction with ground staff staff in the lounge were friendly and helpful cabin crew on the flight were great very welcoming and friendly our meal were delicious no shortage of drink being offered the seat were economy seat with the middle row blocked off and some recline we arrived into stockholm a little early through a snow shower which wa a nice welcome back to stockholm bag checked in at jfk were delivered safely within min of arriving,positive
i recently encountered a highly disappointing experience with british airway specifically regarding their customer service after my initial flight leg wa canceled i wa rebooked with a connection at london heathrow reduced to a mere hour and minute realizing the impracticality of this i promptly contacted british airway within minute to request a more reasonable layover of hour shockingly the customer support representative flatly refused citing an inability to change my flight despite explaining the logistical challenge of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedure i received no assistance to add to the frustration the representative inaccurately noted on my account that i wa presented with multiple option during our conversation moreover the use of military time format and the lack of initial option provided only exacerbated the communication issue both phone and email support proved equally incompetent and i wa informed that customer service is outsourced to india allegedly contributing to the subpar service this experience ha left me not only struggling to rebook my flight but also with a strong resolve to avoid british airway in the future the lack of assistance blame shifting and overall incompetence in customer service make it my worst experience yet i strongly advise others to steer clear of british airway and their appalling customer service,negative
beware ba don t provide any refund due to a very serious medical reason my father wa diagnosed with a severe heart defect a couple of week before his flight date and ba refused to give any refund a this wa not a good enough reason we sent them a medical note from his doctor saying he is unfit to travel due to potential heart failure and need to have heart surgery a soon a possible and the operator totally dismissed it they said only thing they can do is change the travel date within a year heart surgery recovery take month and it s highly unlikely that he will be able to travel within the year meaning he would lose his ticket and money they said they can t do anything to help not even change the name on the ticket so someone else can use the ticket the most ridiculous thing i ve heard,negative
check in wa chaotic and badly organised even though there were two desk one for premium and one economy there ended up being just one queue in front of the premium check in even though most passenger in it were economy that meant that those travelling in club or with higher status had no separate queue to join whilst i wa waiting in line another passenger went up to query and we ended up forming a new line in front of the economy check in desk for premium passenger unnecessarily badly organised the staff in charge should be retrained security at the airport wa very quick and through to the lounge this is a generic airport lounge for all airline and it is actually quite good overall nice layout and seating option reasonable food and drink option and an outdoor terrace which is really nice boarding wa very well organised although quite slow to get everyone on board but the flight wa probably only half full and we still departed early so i think they felt no rush and it actually made the boarding experience nicer and more relaxed on board the club europe seat are fine by european business standard although a previously commented are really not very good overall the meal service wa disappointing a is normal ba do not stock enough of the proper meal option when the option are so limited and varied in quality ba really should stock enough for everyone to have the good meal sadly they had run out by the time they got to me so i had the option of vegetarian sausage or a salad i wanted a hot meal so went for the sausage and i can honestly say it wa one of the most disgusting onboard meal i ve ever had in any cabin class rolling some mush similar consistency to mashed potato into a sausage shape doe not make it a sausage ba you need to improve the meal option make the vegetarian meal something you specifically have to request in advance and offer all passenger a choice of two decent meal then people will not be left with such a substandard alternative when their first choice run out whilst i hadn t planned on using it the on board wifi wa not functioning so wa not available to use overall though the flight wa fairly comfortable and the cabin crew were very friendly and efficient i used avios to pay for the flight so it wa obviously good value for money for me,positive
all of our flight were fine in term of comfort punctuality and service i feel safe with ba and that is my main reason for booking with them even though i could travel with other airline more directly on our return flight atl lhr we skipped the evening meal preferring to sleep and were looking forward to a hearty breakfast prior to arrival at lhr sadly we were seriously disappointed to serve a chicken sausage in a wrap for a business class breakfast is just unacceptable doe ba actually pay expert to design these breakfast low point on an otherwise good trip,negative
i had hoped this would be a good review but unfortunately it won t be i flew business class from lhr to pdx on the ba nonstop it wa a series aircraft the flight attendant specifically mentioned it wa eight year old a he recalled flying it when it wa brand new the business class seat were abysmal my seat wa at the window facing backwards with the divider down which had to be in that position for boarding taxi takeoff and landing i wa literally just a few foot away from the person in the aisle seat who wa facing forward we both couldn t help but stare at one another it couldn t be avoided it wa horrible the service wasn t all that good either the flight attendant did a pre dinner drink when she came back to ask for my choice for dinner she said none of my selection were left i wa a little upset a nothing else appealed to me she then came back later and said the other part of the aircraft had more of the meal selection i wanted i m not sure why they didn t coordinate that to begin with i wa not offered any wine or other drink with with dinner the meal wa put down in front of me and the flight attendant never came back other than to clear the tray overall this flight wa not very good i flew over on american and back on ba and paid round trip i d fly american again my preferred carrier is united or lufthansa i ll never fly ba again,positive
i wa going to fly to frankfurt from glasgow over london but the flight from london to frankfurt wa cancelled this meant i had to stay overnight in london where i have no accommodation etc a i wa rebooked to a flight from london city airport which wa more than h by train i had to get an uber and then take a hotel for in total london price i wa reassured over the phone that i would get all the money back my flight from london city airport wa then cancelled again and rebooked to london heathrow but two day later i then cancelled that flight and rebooked a new one with lufthansa a i urgently had to get to work and needed the money i never received the money back for the hotel compensation for cancelled flight compensation for cancelled flight the extra food i had to pay for the uber or the actual cost of the flight i wa first transferred by british airway they stopped replying to me and told me the issue wa weather condition although other non ba flight were going i lost over in total and never got compensated for the loss of a work day either it just really feel like they don t care about people worst service airline ever,negative
much better experience this time around flew cpt to lhr on a new a checkin wa efficient i used the bidvest lounge at cpt a it is better than ba s lounge boarding wa speedy the new business class club suite are very good slightly irritating to be directed to the wrong seat a instead of k which meant that after settling in the passenger in a showed up we arranged a seat switch second time in a row it ha happened why can t ba staff memorise which side of the plane is which and get it right captain s announcement wa short and on point welcome drink wa served at the correct temperature i e cold first time ever for me previously ba ha always served the welcome champagne warm ife system wa good everything worked a it should felt slightly cheap that business class passenger have to pay for wifi i did not bother cocktail wa good the nut came on a cheap plastic tray which wa naff other airline bring out something classier a female flight attendant came to take my order and i asked for rooibas panacotta and the chicken breast she repeated back to me so you want a p and a c it wa such a bizarre thing to say that i misheard i thought she said so you want beef and sea confusion reigned until she explained to me she had a checklist of passenger order and they abbreviate to first letter so she wa saying p for panacotta and c for chicken but how bizarre to repeat back an order to a passenger in code why not just say so to confirm panacotta to start and chicken a your main dish like every other restaurant airline doe in the world the internal coding of food ordering is exactly that internal she even looked irritated at me that i did not understand her jargon first time the food when it came wa excellent much much better than recent flight i read somewhere that ba changed caterer if so it show the panacotta wa superb a wa the chicken good restaurant quality the wine wa ok to good but definitely not good to excellent i feel that while the food ha got better in ba business class the wine have got worse certainly compared to air france which i have also flown recently the wine wa brought out on time not afer i finished eating a it wa lass time i flew ba business cheese wa also good and not teeth crackingly cold a last time i had a good night s sleep plenty of snack out if you wanted them and they did not run out breakfast wa excellent and the coffee wa hot previously it ha been lukewarm so all in all a vastly improved service offering the staff seemed rushed off their foot it would not hurt to have an extra flight attendant to look after so many business class seat overall summary vastly improved passenger proposition it would be but i deduct a point for showing me to the wrong seat and another point for the bizarre interaction with the female flight attendant who repeated my food order back to me using internal jargon code,positive
once again a terrible business class experience with ba the flight wa delayed by hour the plane wa very old with problem with at least of the seat in business class not cleaned properly prior to departure food wa terrible a always with ba and only one choice available from advertised menu a a result of the delay we missed our connecting flight from heathrow and instead of putting u on the next connection they chose the second last flight of the day which wa also delayed by over an hour meaning we had an additional hour delay whilst at heathrow at no point were we advised about our compensation right despite asking at check in and connection or provided any voucher during the delay having flown etihad qatar and virgin business class equivalent over the last year it is clear to see how big the gulf now is between ba and it rival,negative
ba a s are showing their age hopefully they will update the interior soon because it wa a let down especially when the flight last hour cabin crew were good and helpful dinner wa ok but the breakfast wa grim on board entertainment wa not the latest and seat back usb point didn t work the only upside of ba is that it is only of airline who fly this route directly and their pricing reflects this if you re prepared to lay over then there are better airline out there,positive
credit to ba flew to singapore recently and also back from doha to london and both experience were great service wa fantastic a wa the quality of the food entertainment and wa left feeling ba have got it together after a few previous below average experience you definitely notice the difference with the staff on ba far more approachable and outgoing compared to the cold and corporate middle eastern airline crew nice one ba for great flight,positive
the check in area for premium class at gatwick is very nice and there wa no queue when i arrived so i wa able to drop my bag very quickly premium security at gatwick is fine the flight wa delayed due to nats issue but the member of staff on arriving at the lounge let me know of this the lounge is nicevand it very comfortable there wa an excellent range of food and drink all the drink you would expect food wise there were sandwich soup pasta salad fruit spanish stew a well a turkey and ham pie with mashed potato roasted parsnip and carrot and gravy it wa all really good and particularly nice to see so many option boarding wa pretty slow although the gate crew did a good job to keep it well organised and allow priority passenger to board first a ha been well documented the onboard experience in term of seat on ba europe business is pretty poor but in line with other european carrier sadly that being said the seat is well padded and comfortable and the adjustable headrest is quite good the on board catering wa of excellent quality i wa lucky to get my preferred option of the roast turkey but several people sat near me weren t a lucky i do understand that meal option may run out but when the meal option are roast turkey with all the trimming vegetarian cottage pie or a chicken salad you really should be stocking enough for every passenger to get the proper meal or failing that allow an order in advance service where you then only stock the meal that people want to eat whilst i fully support the desire to minimise waste both food and cost people really should really be able to get the ideal meal option unfortunately one of the people affected reacted very badly to this and took it out on the cabin crew which is unacceptable they also lost a bit of perspective about just how serious a situation it actually wa the cabin crew were very nice friendly and professional if a little slow but not to the point of detracting from the positive experience i had the ground service at gran canaria wa pretty poor priority bag clearly meant nothing of bag coming out were not priority mine came out about halfway through bag delivery and demonstrates poor delivery of service and not fulfilling on the service they promise to their customer overall though it wa a very nice flight and having paid for it using avios and i cannot complain at all,positive
the flight took off a little late due to heathrow congestion but still landed on schedule boarding wa smooth and the onboard service wa efficient a small snack wa served for free with a bottle of water additional item were available for purchase the cabin and toilet were very clean overall an unremarkable flight but in a good way,positive
ba is great in the air but they sell you connection thru london heathrow terminal their private ba only terminal which you are practically not able to make minute stopover time european flight inbound transatlantic flight outbound you arrive at the terminal gate on time and book security endless line slow process your boarding start and you are nowhere near the x ray and then it is a train ride withing the same terminal but different distant building almost impossible to make lot of stress,positive
i had broken my leg day before our return flight from lisbon to london i called to get some assistance from british airway hoping for wheelchair assistance an easier seat to get to or possibly an upgrade so that i could stretch out my broken leg which wa in a cast this airline failed on all front quoted u a price of each i wa traveling with my husband which we could not do almost didn t let me on the plane trying to interpret my medical report they did not attempt to change our seat which were near the back the single concession they made wa to allow me to board st but did not offer a wheelchair so i had to swing myself down the aisle to my seat using the arm rest of all row before my seat a the aisle are not wide enough for crutch might i add i am nearly had to exit same way no wheelchair waiting for me at heathrow had to hop onto bus with crutch to change terminal and nearly took a tumble doing so took so long to get a wheelchair that they had to hold my connecting flight on another airline for me and we were last to board that flight had allowed u to upgrade to business class for a reasonable price and took great care of me,positive
check in at mia straightforward ba use american flagship lounge near gate d which is excellent flight delayed but only by hour boarding chaotic on board staff were fine seat wa fine too but product ageing post take off service prompt slept for hour i noticed that in club world ba have ditched rose champagne which is a shame pre arrival breakfast wa ok slow to deplane luggage off ok,positive
never i saw such a terrible customer experience the plane landed already minute late despite any operational delay the boarding took over hour because the crew did not know where to place the luggage after this long hour boarding process the captain did not apologise this is extremely frustrating when this occurs on a night flight forcing passenger to lose train connection to home,negative
having not flown with ba for a few year i read some of the review in preparation needless to say i boarded this flight with low expectation i wa pleasantly surprised a the flight wa ok we left lhr a few minute early and arrived at jnb ahead of schedule cabin crew although not a good a some carrier were attentive and professional onboard catering wa a disappointment a if you were unlucky to miss out on the chicken you were given a very sloppy pasta on board entertainment ha never been ba s strong point and sadly that hasn t changed unfortunately ba is not the prestigious carrier it once wa but it not a bad from my experience a some review suggest,positive
dear community i feel compelled to share the utter frustration and disappointment that defined my recent travel experience with british airway buckle up folk this one s a rollercoaster on july and i had the displeasure of flying with british airway on ba and ba and let me tell you it wa a nightmare the initial flight from zurich zrh to london lhr on ba faced a seemingly unavoidable one hour delay upon arrival at lhr this of course resulted in me missing my connection to tokyo triggering an automatic rescheduling of my flight to tokyo hnd via beijing with air china oh but the fun didn t stop there flight ca wa also delayed turning my hour delay into a grand total of hour finally arriving in tokyo at instead of the promised and the cherry on top my four checked in suitcase decided to take a detour and didn t join me in tokyo forcing me to waste an additional two hour filling out form at the baggage center i finally got my lost luggage back on july because why make it easy right but wait there s more my return flight from tokyo to zurich ba on august also danced to the delay tune making me question if punctuality is just a myth for british airway the cumulative impact of these delay torpedoed my vacation plan stealing a whole day of scheduled activity including a guided tokyo tour a if that weren t enough i had to dig deeper into my pocket for unforeseen expense extra airport transfer tour operator assistance fee emergency purchase airport meal and international call for rearrangement the lack of assistance at lhr airport wa the icing on this bitter cake installing the ba app just to get basic information about alternative connection flight wa a hassle and the fact that no ba clerk could provide this info in person wa downright infuriating british airway you ve left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a dent in my wallet here s hoping you take this feedback seriously and step up your game because right now it s not a good look frustrated and fed up bert,negative
quick bag drop at first wing but too many passenger so had to use fast track security in main terminal direct entry to concorde room outside security south ate excellent breakfast which wa served promptly concorde room is a nice place to wait for a flight there is some interesting memorabilia and an excellent bar boarding from c gate wa disorganised and slow on board cabin crew excellent good choice of beverage and these were of high quality food wa good seat comfortable no first bedding provided on time arrival into miami baggage took hour to arrive,positive
hour before takeoff we received a mail stating a cryptic message that there are disruption to be expected a there is a limit on how many plane can leave at the same time so did the capacity of the heathrow airport really hit british airway by surprise h before departure anyhow we took the one hour delay so what but then we have been forced to check in our hand luggage i travel only with hand luggage to avoid waiting for the ultra slow processing of the checked in luggage overall h later at home than planed with really no reason just due to incompetent people service level far worse then ryanair and triple the price really never again thanks for nothing,negative
i recently had a delay on british airway from bru to lhr that wa due to staff shortage they announced that there wa a hour holding delay but they would board u immediately in hope of clearing the gate and leaving early we had to wait the full hour inside the airplane the plane wa old dirty had no power at the seat the staff provided a small bag of pretzel and ml of water to the passenger for hour delay and hour flight there were no option to purchase food or drink there were no entertainment option available i am a oneworld emerald elite member but they do not upgrade member based on status first class lounge at heathrow are overcrowded understaffed and poorly equipped the help desk is completely unhelpful when an error arises with delay and cancellation even when having the top status the avios point system ha been devalued to near worthlessness and requires fee to book reward that nearly equal the price of the revenue ticket british ha lost it way in recent year and ha a moved from a world class airline to a budget airline with much worse service and timeliness than ryanair or easyjet,negative
boarded on time but it took age to get to the runway due to congestion flight wa smooth and quick snack and drink were good for a short flight landed only about ten minute late one bag of three left in london form quickly filled in and the bag wa delivered the next morning,positive
day before the flight we were advised by ba that it had been cancelled and asked u to rebook there were flight hour before and hour after our original flight but they made u take one hour earlier our original ticket and the return flight a week later included a checked bag when we arrive at heathrow to check in we are told our ticket doesn t included a bag and we will have to pay pound each to take them we explained that the original ticket had the bag and when they checked the system they confirmed that it did but not this one they would make no effort to sort it out and just told u to pay up or they would remove u from the flight so we had no choice but to pay up thinking it should be pretty easy to get a refund month and email later we have still not seen a penny every time i ask where my refund is and state how long we have been waiting i get an inane email saying some department take longer than others to respond absolutely hopeless airline to stuff up the booking in the first place and even worse customer service to not even attempt to solve the problem at check in even when they could see the mistake they had made in their system compounded by being be unable to investigate a very simple claim and refund me pound in month,negative
we traveled to lisbon for our dream vacation a cruise to portugal and spain our friend did not ever get their luggage it wa a two week cruise two week without a change of clothes or her cpap machine contacting customer service wa a nightmare we never talked to a real person very little effort wa put into getting them their bag in one port we were on the ship and the bag were at the airport the airline did not deliver the bag nor did they tell our friend that they needed to go get them the airline couldn t be bothered to take the bag from the airport to the ship ba say it is their policy to get you your bag within hour that is a joke it s been over two week and they still don t have them they are back home in the u and last they heard the bag were in lisbon if your have a choice do not fly british airway customer service is non existent,positive
booked a flight from bucharest to manchester with a h layover at heathrow flight wa delayed from bucharest because of atc strike arrived at heathrow minute later than scheduled and still had enough time to catch my connecting flight unfortunately we were stranded in the plane and waited a very long time to disembark the plane due to lack of staff or slot shortage it s a common problem with ba at heathrow i missed my connecting flight because of their delay and they told me i had to wait all night in a freezing airport for the first flight the next day there wa just a shameful food voucher which is a joke considering the ridiculous price at lhr no accommodation offered and had to sleep in a very cold airport i asked for compensation and they sent me a long text with the same lame excuse that they are sorry but they will not compensate anything i can t imagine a worst airline than ba regarding customer care it is not about money here but rather than the way they treat customer it is the last time in my lifetime that i will be flying this joke of an airline,negative
booked online month ago and the only hitch wa replacement aircraft meaning chosen seat were different i wa informed of this prior to departure so could amend bag drop at man t wasn t smooth but i suspect that wa man fault shuttle boarding wa slow and delayed meaning a rush at lhr t the flight to cpt wa full but we left more or less on time the cabin wa clean and pe wa what we expected sufficient leg and arm room plus a few little perk with drink only complaint is the seat actually recline too far staff were very good during the first few hour of service especially george food wa quite tasty but one option wasn t loaded breakfast wa also quite tasty and we landed on time the fly in the ointment is both our case arrived late on the carousel and only later did we notice both had been broken into likely at cpt all in all a pleasant surprise,negative
the flight wa on time the crew were polite it wa the same story on my outward flight i find that ba in europe is generally pretty good though i regret that they have substituted prosecco for champagne on the list of drink you can buy in economy so many complaint about ba and other airline revolve around lost luggage that i never check in bag even for long trip,positive
angry disappointed and unsatisfied my route wa from london to atlanta my suitcase wa not boarded therefore not landed with me for both comfort and safety reason a bag always fly with it passenger and that did not happen claim and few phone call were made by desk assistant who answered my question unprofessionally and miserably certainly i wa left with nothing but my backpack which contained not more than few snack neither clothes nor anything else wa ever provided a an apology meanwhile i wa also told that my bag would have been delivered through the next hour which also did not happen british airway is a great airline to fly with but it organization when it come to customer service is poor and uncertain still waiting for my bag,negative
a an infrequent flyer british airway wa always my first choice with some reassurance and comfort of service quality luggage allowance etc in fact i ve never flown with the budget airline my most recent flight ha now changed my view and cause me to reflect on what am i actually getting for my money and is ba what they once were while the flight were around an hour delayed both way the cabin and ground staff service were ok it is the facility or lack of that i am most disappointed by the flight wa approx and a half hour and the only thing offered wa a half cup of water that wa poured out and a bite sized banana slice of cake in fact on my return journey i wasn t even offered the water to top it off ba no longer have a medium screen from which you can select something to pas the time away there wasn t even the obligatory flight journey the wifi wa poor i couldn t even access the shop however for a fee so much more wa available this explains ba record profit of bn so the question is what am i paying for i will now for sure opt for the budget airline they are transparent with what they offer and what you have to pay for which i can decide to choose or not a ba now stand for basic airway i ll go elsewhere and get basic for cheaper,positive
a totally unremarkable flight on time a comfortable a european configuration go no catering due to the storm effect greatly exaggerated this wa advised by email and a euro wa provided not easy to use but lounge made up for this loss,negative
ground crew in heathrow left passenger luggage we had bag the heathrow ground crew left of ours behind after the st two were received the next day the heathrow ground crew lost our rd bag time and we were on the phone with them for over hr over the course of the week due to this we had to spend on health and beauty item for my wife on our cruise british airway said they might reimburse after month we had to spend in cab fare to barcelona because the bacelona ground crew iberia claimed they had delivered it to u heathrow ground crew made u minute late arriving back into heathrow after our cruise we actually landed minute early but those incompetent people still were not ready for u the heathrow ground crew caused u to leave minute late even though all passenger were boarded and ready minute before the departure time this will probably mean we will miss our connection in anchorage ba clearly doe not care or know how to operate a ground base shameful ba is a joke and should be embarrassed they can t operate like a normal airline they do not grasp the concept that even a small hiccup can cause mass ripple of chaos to other people,negative
london heathrow to gibraltar on th october i shall start by reference to the booking process i used the ba website to reserve the seat and food the website to be easy to use and clear in every aspect the flight wa due to depart from terminal but the passenger were bussed for a good minute to a different part of the airport where the aircraft wa on a stand when boarding the flight the cabin crew kept a very low profile and this wa maintained during the entire flight the captain made brief announcement during the flight there wa no in flight entertainment the seat were clean and comfortable enough for a short flight the lack of catering wa overt other than a tiny bottle of water and an inedible breakfast bar one had to use an online system to order even a drink and of course pay for it too the passenger next to me could not use the online system a it doe not seem to work and the cabin refused to sell them a coffee because of this fault moreover the usb charge point did not work either given the early hour of the flight it is a poor show that there are not even for sale item available from a trolley service the system ba have in place is not good enough the flight arrived on time the disembarkation wa inefficient though and poorly managed and the crew were not to be seen the crew were wearing the new ba uniform and it seems to reflect a downward trend of the airline to be candid there wa any difference between this ba service and that of so called budget rival on this route ba have a monopoly and so i did not have an option to use the service of a different company,positive
first time flying british airway and i would not hesitate to fly economy with them again flight attendant were pleasant and efficient excellent special meal low sodium comfortable space in economy one of my better flight,positive
i flew london to cairo and return in october it wa basically a perfectly good pair of flight in economy with pleasant and professional cabin crew especially on the return journey being only m tall i have no problem with legroom in the back of the plane the seat wa ok if getting a little numbing after hour and the return of a rather good included snack box and drink wa welcome however it must be said that the value for money wa poor with a checked bag on the return leg only this wa a nearly ticket and although i am content to pas the time by reading or sleeping it wa surprising to find no in flight entertainment on hour flight however overall i would still recommend ba and would do so even more enthusiastically if it wa more sensibly priced,positive
absolutely the worst experience ever flew into heathrow no problem waited for hour three extra hour for our connection to porto then the cancelled the flight scrambled for a hotel and a new flight the next day they routed u through madrid the next morning that flight wa hour late so we missed our connection to porto because we missed the connection their fault they cancelled our return flight after two hour on the phone with customer service from the madrid airport they booked u a new return flight then they made is pay to fly from madrid to porto then for no reason they cancelled our return flight again after hour and hour and hour with customer service we finally got a return flight five day after our original return flight meanwhile they lost my wife s luggage we finally got day after they lost it return flight more problem with our reservation at no point wa british airway helpful they left the onus on u to fix their mistake at every turn they completely ruined a three week vacation and they don t care they wouldn t even let u speak to a supervisor or manager awful bordering on passenger abuse,negative
flew back from malta after scattering our son s ash at his favourite spot when we boarded the aircraft for our return flight my wife became upset a member of the cabin crew noticed this and immediately spoke to my wife and tried to reassure her her name is tracey an exceptional crew member i noticed she spoke to other traveller in a courteous manner and wa friendly each time she passed my wife she asked how she wa and would she like anything this kindness made a difficult time easier for u both aircraft seat were comfortable and service good for a hr min flight thank you b a,positive
cabin luggage had to go to cargo even when i said i carried medicine there wa no time to get them out the hand luggage the economy seat with virgin atlantic klm and even ryanair have more space luckily it wa a short flight,positive
i have been using ba for a while now and on average i cannot say that i am pretty satisfied ba somehow experience cancellation and delay most of the time second the in flight service is usually weak food portion are small and cabin crew is not very helpful especially when it come to drink request the screen in the a s should be renewed a they are full of scratch and same size a a s especially in longer flight the entertainment system becomes more important there is also no welcome package except for pillow and small blanket i would expect more from ba if you are flying from the u to anywhere except the uk i would recommend considering other airline but if you are flying to from uk directly then ba could be one of your choice,positive
i flew from istanbul to london in business class for more than half of the flight a child wa watching an ipad very loud with no phone plugged in it wa three row in front of me and disrupted my flight a i could hear it above my headphone staff thought this wa fine and refused to tell the mom to turn it down why is this acceptable on a flight especially in business class ha this airline turned into a zoo are staff given no training in customer service why is a child allowed to disrupt other passenger when i told the staff she just laughed at me ba customer service is a disgrace i ve not even mentioned the food but it wa bad really bad,negative
i have flow on ba several time since the airline started non stop service between austin tx and london heathrow every year the service get worse i brought a tape measure with me to see how far apart the seat are in the economy section inch ba ha removed bathroom in order to squeeze a few more row of seat onto the aircraft thankfully i m not a big person and wa able to squeeze into my seat without being too uncomfortable when ba first started flying out of austin the food wa great now when i arrive at heathrow i get real food and take it on the plane with me i don t know where or who make ba s food but it is not eatable if ba did not have a direct flight from my hometown to london i would fly with a different airline when we checked into heathrow the line wa extremely long and only one person wa checking people in it took nearly an hour to get to the counter i understand airline are making record profit and need to make up lost revenue from the pandemic but i think ba ha gone too far and ha little concern for customer service in pursuit of profit,positive
the flight departed over an hour late due to a late inbound plane the plane wa very full and half of the economy class passenger were forced to check in their larger cabin baggage at the gate when boarding making a complete mockery of the hand luggage allowance advertised lot of passenger on board were stressed out about missing onwards connection due to the delay and some did miss them a their next gate had closed by the time we disembarked at heathrow onboard service wa ok but minimal ba gave up being a full service airline some time ago more concerning is that trying to get hold of customer service to make change to booking and deal with problem wa non existent the airline seems to make it deliberately hard for it customer to contact it,negative
i hate british airway we get to london on oct and our next flight is cancelled we stand in line with other people to get it fixed and they tell everyone to leave the airport and call them to fix they book u the next day via online don t offer voucher for hotel we will miss our tour now trying to get home from istanbul plane is here but should have started loading an hour ago no explanation may miss next flight will never travel with them again wa this same problem april flight,negative
our ba flight from porto to london heathrow t wa operated by finnair using a finnair plane and crew this had been advised by ba shortly after booking with the option to change flight if we preferred although the business class cabin wa of a similar layout to ba club europe i e with the middle seat kept free my wife and i felt the seat were more comfortable and the legroom slightly better service wa good on board and the meal wa very tasty we chose the beef cheek all wa good until we landed at heathrow although we passed through passport control without delay once we were at the designated baggage reclaim we just waited and waited after an hour and ten minute i went to the ba baggage counter to ask what wa going on they seemed unaware of an issue but said they would find out over the next hour or so various other passenger also requested information and despite various announcement and a list of different excuse it wa almost hour before the bag finally arrived frustrating to say the least i subsequently complained to ba but after week there ha been no explanation just the automated message from customer service we are experiencing exceptionally high volume this response say a lot,positive
the customer service call centre etc are atrocious and sometimes callous they just don t care long wait to speak to anybody who then have no power to actually solve anything and the call just cut halfway without resolution anyway if the flight are cancelled a were my original one you re really left on your own and nobody care the onboard service are so so but for short haul it s now semi low cost which is confusing a you never know what to expect this time we were given a bottle of water and a very small snack whilst anything else had to be paid for and yet on some other flight apparently you have to pre order any additional food it s confusing which make it not dependable cabin baggage is in theory generous compared to competitor in economy but then they asked more than half the passenger on this flight to check in the cabin baggage at the gate due to lack of space in the overhead cabin leading to long boarding delay their whole offering hasn t been thought through very well the usb power supply did not work throughout the flight contrary to the announcement that the power be available after the seatbelt sight wa turned off so it wa pointless providing the socket in the first place not my first choice airline on this route and am just trying to use up most of my avios point before i totally abandon them i fail to see how it is deemed a star airline,negative
i am a frequent flyer with ba and have been for the last year having noted the rating given frankly i cannot understand how ba score three star for most aspect of it service in a nutshell ba ha placed profit margin over passenger appreciation this fact wa hammered home on my return leg which wa not in club europe quite alarmingly ba appears to place profit over passenger safety by extending it business class seating up to and beyond emergency exit row and then failing to ensure those seated in exit row have the physical capacity to actually open the door incase of an emergency i wa not at all reassured to see an elderly and slightly built woman seated with the responsibility of opening the overwing exit should the need have arisen short haul business club europe is simply a joke and only useful for gaining valuable tier point for lounge pre boarding benefit while cabin crew service is excellent the lack of space and reduction in refreshment choice etc place them a million air mile behind competing airline such a qatar turkish or emirate who understand the true definition of customer appreciation and hospitality ba ha consistently eroded the value of their executive club and seems to be of the impression that recent change in obtaining avios point during the booking process benefit passenger really i want to support ba and did enjoy flying with them up to the point when they started penny pinching and became more deserving of the name budget airway the attached photo taking during my most recent itinerary highlight the difference in customer care appreciation between british airway and another airline used in this trip both flight were around hour in duration on the same day guess which one is show ba s in flight offering,positive
flew with ba to punta cana took the trouble to reserve seat for both outbound and inbound flight on boarding at gatwick realised we had been moved to much less good seat with other people sitting in the seat we had spent a lot of money reserving apparently there ha been a change of aircraft and a number of passenger had been automatically reallocated seat for no particular reason the crew said there wa nothing they could do although of course they could just have swapped u with the couple using our seat we were told to claim a refund on return home we did this via a complaint form n ba offered u in voucher we didn t accept this a it wa less than the cost of the seat and also naturally we wanted our money back we eventually got it but not without a fight very second rate shoddy airline,negative
they downgraded me from business to premium economy they took three month to get back to me and offered me pound or aud the difference between business class and premium economy which i never fly is aud and the difference between economy and business is aud they owe me at least pound and to be very fair pound the downgrade wa insulting and incredibly painful a i had a recent cancer operation and have a back injury which i have pointed out to them i need to lie down the wait for them to get around to me ha been numbing the insult of their offer ha been the slap in the face to continue my degradation the people i have dealt with at the airport have been down to earth honest hard working people the actual staff on the plane were warm and friendly and helpful the system under which ba operates are some sort of medieval torture,negative
the already delayed aircraft landed and apart from the small ba logo on the rear of the fuselage there wa no indication a to whom the carrier really wa boarding turned into a farce with passenger group being told to wait in one queue in order to board only to be informed we were on the wrong place and our boarding wasn t allowed yet the interior cabin wa reminiscent of a ba cabin from twenty year earlier except the tight legroom and uncomfortable seating which made a budget airline feel luxurious the crew were not ba but from an unknown charter company service wa slow and a usual choice of food to purchase ran out before they d reached row i requested a cup of tea which never appeared thank goodness for my airport purchased water and the tiny offering of pretzel the over officious senior flight attendant who d been facilitating in club europe appeared in economy and immediately slammed down the armrest whilst still in mid flight making an already uncomfortable journey feel worse cattle class wa definitely that to say i wa happy to land and disembark wa an understatement never again ba never again,negative
caught up in the gatwick cancellation fiasco at some point between what wa smooth check in unable to do online a part of group travel and security the flight wa cancelled we were denied entry to security and departure a a result it wa at this point that we discovered ba gatwick are not ba but a masquerade who are unable to help and and provide very little assistance unless the real ba provide information and even though our baggage wa now airside didn t have a clue a to how we could get it back it is however with thanks to a supervisor from business class check in who came to our assistance and help with our predicament baggage retrieval information on what to claim and how and our revised ba flight from lhr the following evening difficult to give a rating for cabin service a we didn t even board the aircraft,positive
ba ha a real problem with boarding it s flight those who get on first fill the luggage bin with bag one of which is supposed to be small and under seat only cabin staff don t bother implementing their own rule subsequent passenger mill up and down the aisle bumping into each other searching for space boarding this flight took an hour a a result of this nonsense the incoming flight wa late already so our minute flight wa minute late,negative
our connecting flight from london to glasgow wa canceled and we were forced to wait hour in the airport for a new flight when we received our luggage at glasgow we discovered that our luggage wa soaking wet my wife s luggage content were wet and had to be air dried,negative
the worst airline i have ever flown with allocated the very back row next to the toilet and galley no chance of getting any sleep question asked of possible seat movement ignored and getting bumped the entire time by cabin crew walking or pushing kart up and down aisle without one apology would have been better sitting in the luggage compartment,negative
excellent service level proactive crew and superb food and beverage i found all aspect of the service to be superior to ba business class even the new ba club suite first class felt exclusive the dedicated crew were clearly used to working the premium cabin enjoying their work were proactive friendly very respectful and the food and beverage offering a considerable step up from business class the seat with sliding double door wa spacious well designed and very comfortable british airway offered a solid first class service from concorde lounge to boarding which wa actually by group number for a change to the very warm and genuine welcome on boarding a consistent solid comfortable service from start to finish and if the price wa right i would not hesitate to book first class with british airway again,positive
booked a very special holiday for me and my partner september arrived and we were on our way to lovely south of france booked business class for u both to start the holiday right a we were checking i wa told the flight wa over booked and our seat wouldn t print onto the ticket for some reason we had already made sure the seat were booked when we had booked the flight nearly a year prior to going unfortunately when we arrived at the gate we were then told we would no longer be sat together and one of u would in fact have to go into economy my girlfriend is an extremely nervous flyer and so had to take extra tablet to remain calm she didn t have any food which we had pre booked also and she wa sat right down the bottom end of the flight we were held at the gate with another or couple all in the same predicament all due to the lovely money grabbing british airway over booking the flight they ended up refusing passenger in the end and even had people sat on the fold down chair in the toilet area when we eventually arrived in france late we wa waiting for our luggage to come our airtags stated that both our case wa in fact still in heathrow we then had to wait day for them to eventually come into france by this point our holiday wa ruined british airway wa absolutely shocking we couldn t speak to anyone a all the phone number were no longer in use we felt stranded in a foreign country with no clothes and no one to help use with what to do next every day we watched them case not moved a we were tracking with air tag it wa so frustrating not being able to plan our day in hope we would get the call to then drive all the way back to the air port hour each way to collect our case we ended up going out and buying new clothes toiletry and all the stuff to make the best of our ruined holiday saving all the receipt thinking we would be able to claim it all back how wrong i wa british airway take zero responsibility and fob me off with going through my insurance british airway only pay for basic essential pant and toothpaste i filed a complaint when i got back and requested my money back for business class and they haven t even had the decency to even respond they are an absolute joke of a company and i wish they would remove british out of there name because there is nothing british about them do not give them your money they cant even look after their staff let alone customer oh and don t bother trying to cancel your flight either a they just take all of your money off you and give you nothing back,positive
just returned from chicago flew out day ago on american airline absolutely superb in every way had high expectation on return flight with ba what a disappointment the airbus a may be nice from a pilot perspective but a a passenger it wa awful very uncomfortable seat the inflight entertainment and flight tracker failed to work throughout the flight the inflight meal wa inedible and the service wa mediocre at best our short flight from heathrow to manchester wa much improved very welcoming and attentive in flight staff and the flight even arrived early in future we will travel with one of the american carrier,positive
ba standard continue to decline every time i fly with them this time a min late departure which seems the norm for ba and no information from the rude and clueless boarding gate staff the club lounge wa overcrowded dirty and grubby and cleaning staff could not cope how many more cutback is ba going to apply before they become truly low cost a a year veteran user of ba while people complained of alex cruz cutting cost the past year ha seen them decline very quickly under their latest ceo one read the occasional article about ba improving thing but i have yet to see anything substantive there seem to be few british staff left amongst the cabin crew so maybe time for a name change and give the flag carrier status to a proper low cost and sadly the staff service ha declined year on year onboard the catering remains poor and surprised that do co can produce such rubbish meal when i have sampled their turkish airline equivalent in august that wa superb guessing ba are too tight with their budget onboard wifi service is a joke and should be avoided,negative
awful business class check in queue just a long a for economy probably because half of the desk were not staffed and terminal is chaotic business lounge overfull couldn t get seat delayed flight unmanaged chaos at the gate no drink on boarding first drink served an hour after take off the meal wa poor used to get better in economy on other airline british airway ha won the race to the bottom of the cheapskate stake not looking forward to the flight home,negative
not a reliable airline you cannot trust the timing at all i had a am flight boarding wa on time but then we are sitting in the plane for already hour and the expected departure is still not clear they have discovered the engine is not working i am risking to be late for a business meeting in geneva how come they bring a not working plane to the gate the funny thing is that i had another business trip in spring also with ba to amsterdam when i arrived to the airport that time i wa told i don t have a seat i wa put on the next flight in several hour which should have get me to the business meeting late but still not too much a lot of stress in the end on the second plane we were sitting in the cabin for hour and i have missed the meeting i thought it wa a dramatic unlucky case that time but today i see it s routine for ba not to fly on time,negative
i take comfort in reading the last ten or so review to see i m not the only traveller to put in word how absolutely abysmal british airway are the only reason we are stuck using this awful airline is to use up point we booked club europe month ago london to athens sat in row and told they had run out of food option only choice wa lentil pie or green curry returning athens to london club europe couldn t check in online a promised so arrived at the airport hr early to be told they had overbooked the flight and basically we were being bumped to economy this airline fails to deliver time and time again it is a national disgrace and i implore everyone to choose an alternative,negative
the worst journey in my life the connection time at lhr wa only hour but the flight from mxp wa on delay i had to rush to change terminal by train and arrived risking a heart attack after that the plane just stayed there for another minute despite that upon arrival at sjc my baggage wa lost i filled the form and gave to the employee i wa not given any receipt so i did not have any reference number ba phone number at sjc simply never answer i called twice the toll free number and realized they did not record the delivery address i had to enter myself online dealing with a shitty website they delivered the baggage three day later i claimed for compensation online a i had to buy clothes and other stuff and i did never get a receipt i wa expecting an upgrade for the flight back to mxp but nothing happened neither they allowed me to enter ba lounge at sjc bad customer service the only positive side wa price but obviously this cannot justify this treatment and if i knew i would never flown by ba never again,negative
the airplane and the lounge are worn out old and broken from dallas to heathrow multiple first class seating and electronics were non functional and poorly designed the first class seating from heathrow to dubrovnik wa nothing more than a tray blocking the middle seat of a standard coach ticket very disappointed,negative
one of the worst experience on the worst airline the flight wa delayed due to earlier technical issue the time slipped from to to and finally cancelled there wa zero information given despite paying well over the odds for business class we were booted out of the ba lounge two hour before the flight when it wa finally cancelled the ba staff without explanation told everyone to go to a gate after another hour or so they made u re enter the uk via passport control a further minute wait by now the airport wa closing and there wa no sign of our bag or any help from ba a passing gatwick engineer finally helped u locate the bag ba completely washed their hand of u and in contravention of caa rule refused to find u accommodation many slept in a bus stop overnight there were people with young child who couldn t find somewhere to stay and yet ba had closed down and left the following day the replacement flight wa also late and due to an admin mistake had no catering or liquid for a hr flight overall the service wa shockingly bad the worst i have experienced from any airline i will not ever use them again,negative
cancelled our flight last minute then moved u onto a flight day later operated by japan airline we had paid a lot extra for extra legroom seat a i am very tall and they assigned me a middle seat deep in the middle of the plane because it wa operated by a different airline but booked by ba neither ba nor the other airline could change my seat over the phone despite seat being available after hour of waiting in queue and sitting on hold their solution wa for me to arrive early at the airport i did but the seat had already been given away for free by people who had booked directly with that airline and could check in online i got a meal voucher a compensation for this enormous downgrade on a hour flight never again will i fly ba i would rather fly indirect with better airline than use this disgrace of an airline again,positive
i had a flight from miami florida to dublin ireland via london s heathrow airport the outbound flight from miami wa delayed and we were further delayed when our gate wa occupied when we arrived in heathrow the total delay wa roughly an hour but it wa enough to make our connection a challenge where we had minute between original arrival time until the departure time to dublin when we headed to our connection flight we were stopped by security personnel at a checkpoint and told u that the gate to our connection flight had already closed this wa twenty minute prior to departure time they ushered u to customer service to be rebooked given the busy weekend of travel we were rebooked on a flight at a different airport and were told that our cost to get there would be reimbursed we then waited hour for our luggage and then took a cab to london s city airport the cab fare wa roughly when i filed a claim with british airway they refused the claim and told me that we had plenty of time to make our connecting flight and therefore they denied my claim to be reimbursed for the cab fare this is after i explained that it wa british airway employee who ushered u to rebook the flight despite the minute timeframe to make the connecting flight the person who rebooked u told u it wa policy that they close the gate minute prior to departure i will never fly this awful airline again given the other feedback on this site it appears that that is the overwhelming sentiment,negative
we started our day with ba in prague the flight actually left on time i came to find out that s very unusual we purchased business class seat a you can see from the picture they hardly were business class all they did wa block off the middle seat in the first few row and called it business class horrible flight in addition i had a really rude rude check in clerk basically yell at me when i excused myself and asked if she could give a little bit of priority to the many business class passenger who weren t being served then we got to heathrow and the real fun began we had a hour delay they gave u about different excuse for the delay i had a few employee walk away while i wa asking them question they were very rude at one point there were no employee left and from the announcement it seems virtually every ba flight wa delayed and there were no weather issue there wa no place to comfortably store item in business class i ve never experienced that before not even a cup holder for my bottle of water the seat control didn t work well you had to keep pushing the button to get them to do anything the power outlet didn t work there wa no internet the entire flight the overhead luggage bin wa too heavy i almost got a hernia having to close it this is a horrible airline i ll never fly with them again if i could give zero star i would,negative
i fly british airway weekly not because i want to but because they own the route there s no other option therefore they frankly don t have to care about the customer the flight are always delayed and it s always someone else s fault be it weather delay to incoming aircraft or flight traffic control issue i ve heard it all and for the life of me cannot understand why they are allowed to operate i ve been around the world and traveled with all of the world s airline but british airway are really the worst of the worst it s such a shame to have watched what used to be a good company fall down a cliff my advice is if you have an option to fly with anyone else then exercise the option but if you re flying with different connection and you have a tight schedule do not expect ba to get you to your destination in time,negative
everything wa ok until our connecting flight in london just before take off we were on the runway the pilot came on to announce an engine problem after engineer tried to fix it while we waited on the plane for over an hour we were finally told that we would have to be evacuated and rebooked for another flight but not to worry because a special crew wa waiting for u on the ground to help u and set u up in a hotel except that there wa no one to help u in fact everyone refused to help u it wa saturday almost pm and they just wanted to go home anyone with a connecting flight couldn t rebook on the application because the app wouldn t disassociate our first flight with the connecting one in london and the staff saw this but still refused to help u they gave u a phone number but there wa only a message that said just to use the app finally i got someone on the phone who rebooked u for the next day now it s pm and i have to find a hotel room because the airline refused also to help u with that so i had choice either sleep in the airport or pay over gbp for a room i don t have the money to pay for this but after a hour flight hour of jet lag and the insane stress after the fact that no one from british airway would help u i took the room of course i claimed reimbursement but that wa over week ago and i haven t heard anything since so i have no idea when or how much i ll be reimbursed even though i m not claiming any emotional compensation from the horrible situation they put me through due to their total indifference it s financially difficult for me right now because the money i had to put out is equal to half my salary and of course it s impossible to reach them by phone i feel still a i did on august completely trapped by them and their indifference with no solution or information,negative
my initial flight wa cancelled hour prior the flight then i wa automatically rescheduled for next day next day the flight wa delayed leaving hamburg and missed my connecting flight to la vega me and several other passenger spent the night in london british airway provided u with voucher but the transfer bus dropped u at the wrong hotel closest to our hotel and told u that we can walk there if we want to a a result i lost two night hotel reservation that i made in la vega i opened a claim and provided all receipt to british airway to get refund of my hotel reservation but over week now not a single feedback from british airway i will avoid all flight with them in future and will share this story,negative

despite boarding being the usual free for all at lhr with group being called to board all at once whilst those passenger who had agreed to check in a bag in at the gate getting to board before anyone else however the service on board wa impeccable superb crew friendly attentive interacting with passenger and generally appearing to be enjoying their job like ba in the old day and at it best food choice and quality seems to have improved too no beef cheek thankfully and even the club kitchen appears to have returned old style club seating but is at least better and feel less cramped on the s,positive

british airway ha a total lack of respect for it customer i wa booked to fly from frankfurt main to london city airport and just a couple of hour before the scheduled departure the flight wa suddenly cancelled by ba without explanation when i wa already at the airport the worst thing wa the utter callousness that staff showed towards customer the ground staff s attitude wa that they are merely third party agent not ba employee and therefore they quickly washed their hand of u all telling u we had to contact ba directly via phone if we wanted help they couldn t even provide u a phone number telling u to look it up on ba com so ba abandoned it passenger they did tell u that the ba departure to heathrow had also been cancelled meaning there would be no further ba flight from frankfurt to london that day although other airline were still operating the route but ba refused to rebook u on them the reason given for both cancellation wa technical reason no assistance or information wa provided on our right due to cancellation nor any information on help regarding food accommodation help etc their attitude wa literally that the cancellation had nothing to do with them and it wa our problem not theirs i received an email an hour later notifying me that i had been automatically rebooked on an alternative flight hour later which wasn t acceptable a i had to get back to london that night i rang ba s call centre and again they showed a high degree of callousness of the half hour call wa spent with me waiting on hold with the phone just cutting off after half an hour and no meaningful information given to me by that point there wa no attempt by the call operator to call me back when the line cut and i had a solid phone signal and wifi a i wa still standing in terminal of frankfurt main airport even though my phone number is listed in my booking contact detail they just don t care in the end i had to arrange my own return to london by taking a coach to hanh airport which wa km away waiting there for hour and then booking an expensive last minute ticket with ryanair to stansted at least that flight operated on time and got me back to london ba is worse than a low cost carrier now,negative
london heathrow to keflavik iceland in business class on an a british airway provides an unusual business class experience for intra europe flight the seating is similar to most airline middle seat vacant and little extra space but on british airway the business class cabin extends to almost half the aircraft this make it less than a premium experience at every step from boarding to onboard the wifi worked for only half the flight and there are no refund but when it worked it wa surprisingly fast service on this flight wa very good and we got to keflavik on time,positive
mumbai to london heathrow in business class on an ageing b this aircraft featured the older club world flatbed seat they are comfortable there is enough storage space around the cubicle and the monitor screen is among the larger one i ve seen on airplane ba s new club suite are said to be far superior competing with the best b class rival the entire business class cabin had just washroom but it wasn t an issue on this flight since the premier section wasn t at full capacity there wa wi fi on board fast enough to even send video via messaging apps service onboard wa competent but the staff lacked warmth the food wa alright and no more the biggest plus of this flight is that it get out of bombay at pm in the afternoon instead of the ungodly early morning hour most international flight take off from india the airport experience is far more pleasant at this time in summary british airway provides a good but not spectacular business class product,positive
care and support shocking written by a previously loyal ba traveller lie and misleading unprofessional service told that my flight wa cancelled booked on to next available flight in downgraded cabin from business to premium economy called to ask why told technical fault with my original flight my suspicion wa another reason at airport check in staff said that not enough crew to staff original flight earlier in day why take my money and allow me to book a flight which would have allowed me to get to work a a doctor in the first place how can you trust such an organisation to look after you a a flying customer,positive
flying a business class should be a pleasure but ba ha made it a disaster with the worst seating and configuration imaginable how could any sane person could jam so many seat into a limited space and expect passenger to be happy seat are narrower than economy on some airline and you must face another person until a plastic screen is raised the tv screen are the size of a medium sized tablet and the control are behind your head in a sitting position there is no where to put anything except one small pull out draw at ground level that can not be reached when seated nor accessed when sleeping the window seat and middle seat are accessed by having to jump over a passenger on an aisle seat and the seat are so low that they are hard for elderly to get out of the whole business class set up is a sick joke eating is difficult because the seat is not close enough to the table and the table are so flimsy that drink can fall off are there any redeeming feature the answer is no if you like a little comfort avoid ba like the plague,negative
british airway absolutely doe not care my reserved seat wa change from an aisle to center seat for this overnight full flight and it wa quite awful after enquiring at lax check in the agent said sorry nothing we can do onboard the flight the attendant seemed to try and finish the meal service at a racing speed with meal tray passed out with no proper question about choice then back and clearing tray and they disappeared to rest in the kitchen for hour after that no water run if you need anything do not bother with the call bell a they simply ignore it i used to like travelling british airway year ago but the bean counter have been in and lowered it close to a lowcost carrier i guess staff are badly paid from their terrible attitude and service my last trip to london wa with delta they are so much better than this very poor excuse of an airline that british air ha now become,negative
my recent experience with british airway wa not just horrendous it wa an utter abdication of responsibility on their part i arrived at jfk ready for my flight to malaga only to find it had been cancelled with zero notice after a draining hour altercation i wa finally placed on a different flight the nightmare continued when i landed in malaga sans luggage containing essential for my son s wedding thirty agonizing hour later the bag showed up but my brand new ipad and a special watch for my nephew were missing the item weren t merely valuable they had emotional significance which made the loss even more gut wrenching you d think a reputable airline would make amends for such error despite the clear mishandling of my baggage by their team they refused to offer any reimbursement or even a modest amount of airline credit their customer service wa not only ineffective but also astonishingly callous their response wa in essence it s your fault for trusting u with your belonging this isn t just poor customer service it s a complete disregard for basic human decency and responsibility british airway had numerous opportunity to right their wrong and chose not to if you have any respect for your time belonging and emotional well being avoid british airway at all cost they not only fail to deliver on promise but also refuse to make amends when they err leaving customer to bear the brunt of their incompetence,negative

terrible experience with british airway i booked a flight with ba to travel from gibraltar to london heathrow on may my flight wa scheduled to leave at p m in the afternoon i had originally planned on leaving my luggage at heathrow upon arrival and travelling to visit and overnight at my cousin s place en route to gib airport a few hour prior to departure i checked my flight detail and found out that my flight had been cancelled i had a connecting flight booked with westjet from london heathrow to vancouver the following day and i had to make that flight so it wa imperative that i got to london i checked the ba website and couldn t find any other flight with them that would work so unfortunately i made the mistake of requesting a refund i managed to find a flight out of malaga that got me into london just after p m so i booked that and then called british airway a i wanted to discus compensation that s when they advised me that because i had requested a refund they used the phrase abandoned travel with them they were not prepared to do anything for me apparently i should have called them first and then they would have made the arrangement of course they don t explain that on their website they just ask if you want a refund and then proceed and even when i plead my case with the agent at malaga airport and then followed up with customer relation several time via email they flat out refused to budge i had used a travel voucher to cover the cost of my flight and had used avios to cover the cost of my checked baggage so in other word no out of pocket cost for the trip once this incident happened i ended up spending euro in airfare and checked baggage charge to get to london from malaga i e different airport than the one i had originally booked from and because the luggage storage facility at heathrow had closed by the time i eventually arrived i ended up booking a night at a hotel since i couldn t travel by train to my cousin s place any longer bag in tow and i didn t want to put him out and have him drive to the airport to pick me up this cost me another in room and meal cost all ba ended up doing to compensate me wa to give me free avios a mere pittance compared to my out of pocket expense despite trying to explain to them why i requested the refund instead of calling them first they wouldn t budge very easy for them to say what i should have done since they work there and know the rule and they weren t the one scrambling to find alternative travel arrangement within a few hour i pointed out that on their website they should simply instruct customer to call them when this situation happens and that way they would never encounter this problem my feeling is that they put the refund option out there in the hope that customer will make the mistake i did so they can then wash their hand of the situation and ultimately save money i ve been an executive club member for year and they simply didn t care they said there wa nothing they could do i m sure if one of the ba executive s friend or family member had gone through this staff there would have been given the instruction to make thing right i used to be a fan of ba but they have really gone downhill in my opinion once i used up my remaining avios and travel credit i will cancel my executive club membership and never fly with them again,positive

a simple story with an unfortunate outcome that really could happen to anyone my partner and i recently started working after studying purchased two ticket to travel from london city airport to frankfurt when we purchased the ticket i mistakenly entered my name twice e g mr john smith and m john smith little did we know that our simple mistake would cost u over pound upon arriving at the airport we were told there wa no way to change the name apparently they can only change letter where there ha been a typo and i had no other option to purchase the last remaining ticket if i wanted to board the flight the price almost seven time higher than my original ticket zero empathy wa shown zero alternative wa offered trusting ba s staff and under the pretence that there wa apparently no other way we could board the flight we bought this ticket immediately after i purchased the ticket i contacted ba s commercial change booking team and informed them of our situation the service representative apologised and told me they could have changed the name at the cost of a small fee he offered to cancel my original ticket and issue me a partial refund then advising me that i had a claim to the difference and i should contact customer support to do so i told this person several time i wanted to claim the cost of the new ticket and even asked him explicitly if by accepting this offer i would be denied from claiming the cost of the new ticket he said no i could claim the difference fair enough we accepted this offer and lodged a ticket with customer support for the difference two day later british airway customer response informed u that we were unable to lodge a claim because we had voluntarily accepted the cancellation before the flight they ve continued to send generic email until this week when they just stopped responding so in short british airway misled and deceived my partner into accepting a lowball offer to waive our right to claim a refund it keep me up at night thinking how they can do this and get away with it so easily,positive
flight wa delayed due to the inbound flight arriving late there wa no announcement to inform of the delay nor were the sceens updated when ready to board we were requested to take our seat quickly to help reduce the delay which people did the pilot then announced he had received the document for the wrong flight from ground staff so we had to wait while they returned to get the right paperwork after this wa resolved the pilot announced there would be a delay a there wa only two push back tractor and we had to wait again so after rushing to sit quickly we sat the the aircraft at the gate for nearly one hour which is longer than the flight take of course am is not ba home base and it us contracted staff here but it should require a better level of service it wa embarrassing hearing the pilot apologise at every step of the way it ll be eurostar for me next time,positive
fast and friendly check in total contrast to gatwick the contract lounge is comfortable and spacious with a bar and pleasant staff but you have to pay for alcohol after the one free glass of wine food best avoided on board great crew and dinner wa actually good quality and substantial apart from the chocolate and orange pot that seems to appear on every flight have they bought up the global stock the crew were always ready to top up drink although white wine and beer were lukewarm the crew explained that the cart are supposed to be chilled from experience they rarely are is dry ice so expensive that ba can t afford it,positive
i don t understand why british airway is classified a a star airline the service is really mediocre the food is untasty and insufficient for a long haul trip some member of the cabin crew are friendly but they are not attentive enough and create a very basic experience this really is all about getting from point a to b without what it used to be an enjoyable trip making experience the inflight entertainment is fairly good but you do need to bring your own water not to get dehydrated some snack and ideally food and perhaps smile to yourself a otherwise you are faced with just a cold personality less experience,positive
i m sure that ba have gradually made their economy experience ba euroflyer out of gatwick so miserable that passenger are tempted to upgrade to the lacklustre and overpriced business class long wait at the biz checkin due to status and dealt with by a bored agent ok third party but still representing ba who hardly spoke and avoided eye contact and wa more focussed on her fingernail lounge wa crowded and grubby but at least the staff there are pleasant and helpful on board the seat are cramped and uncomfortable and it took over two hour before crew appeared with food sale and the free water which on gatwick service consists of a half full plastic cup rather than the luxury of a small bottle a fellow passenger mentioned the delay and the fact that they had no sandwich for sale which prompted the flight attendant to say that the service wa much better on easyjet who do two service run etc,positive

my family and i have flown mostly on british airway for the last year i am a priority passenger and fly often enough to recognise cabin crew and know some by name they used to be a really good airline to fly with thing have really deteriorated with their face to face customer care since the pandemic the aircraft look worn for example on my flight back my audiovisual equipment did not work and had to be reset twice finally working in the last hour before we landed the second time around i think the reset wa done for the whole aircraft the touch screen function on my screen did not work the usb charger port on my seat did not work the staff were pleasant enough but their service oozed mediocrity there did not seem to be much pride in what they were doing the food ha been the worst part on our ba flight since the pandemic they gave u a menu asked what we d like did a check and then told u that it wa not available a they had run out and would we like to choose something else they then told u that we d get first choice at the second service which they couldn t deliver on finally after choosing and getting whatever it is that we did the food wa tasteless we take part in post flight survey regularly and have stated all of this to no avail a a family of we fly british airway medium to long haul regularly possibly time a year each for u the good thing about flying ba are that we are priority customer usually have a direct flight to our destination and get good service on the ground when checking in and in the lounge when we use them,positive
this ha been by far the worst service i have had on a plane it s very obvious that if you are flying economy and not a frequent traveler of british airway they care very little about you we had to wait an hour for them to even open the check in once they did they had line and only one that serviced economy even though the line for economy wa three time the length of the premium class then they told economy passenger that all bag had to be check and no carryon due to a full flight and no room in the overhead compartment once we arrived at the gate there were not enough seat to fit everyone and you couldn t leave the boarding area i will never fly this airline again,negative

cairo is a hour flight and ba considers it to be short haul so everyone is crammed in with knee pressed up against the seat in front and nothing in the way of inflight entertainment not even a magazine which is now available by wifi that you have to pay for you have to pay for your seat choice checked in baggage food drink wifi not that i have anything against that i m used to that on budget airline but this is for a premium price ticket i would have preferred to fly on easyjet where the initial ticket would have been less and the extra would have been half the price the ba app and website make it really difficult to understand the extra and we ended up with baggage on the wrong ticket so had to pay extra and don t get me started on their customer service helpline on board the staff are ok but on the long cairo london route they spend most of their time on a break where they use the back row or two and talk loudly without any consideration for the passenger and for the flyer who don t want the hassle of charge minimal cabin service and budget seat then they could easily provide a premium economy option and really make a difference for the experience heathrow terminal compound the poor experience especially for arrival it is also poorly served by transport link especially for those of u who live near gatwick which is being abandoned by ba i have been a frequent flyer for many year and wa even a ba gold card holder at one point so i know about the potential experience i used be able to make the choice do i fly budget or do i fly more comfortably for more now it s a case of flying budget or flying budget for double the price with ba,negative

beware of british airway and their marketing to make you believe that they are full of class and level above the rest they won t treat you that way when you get bumped from a flight and it is their responsibility to compensate you for their mistake we recently had a trip home planned from mr to sea a mechanical issue meant that we departed late from mr to lhr where we needed to make a connecting flight we landed with plenty of time to make it to our next gate but a series of issue and choice by british airway kept u from boarding our next plane the crew did not let off passenger with connecting flight first nor did they hold the next flight for a mere minute for passenger to make connection on their airline plus we discovered that we had actually been bumped off our next flight before we even landed we were pushed to virgin atlantic to figure out how to get u home it extended our travel day by hour we were traveling with child a well no offer of compensation or upgrade were made and now ba is refusing to provide u any financial compensation we paid for a trip home with only one connection and instead had two connection multiple airline to deal with security through an extra airport with kid for a midnight flight we were never planning on that is not what we paid for but ba refuse to make it right so beware potential traveler,negative

top ten reason to not use british airway to all be aware and be on notice travel at your own risk i have travelled for year on many different airline and i have to say that british airway rank a one of the top two most horrible airline to fly don t waste your time or money customer service is non existent please be on notice that if you purchase a ticket from them and once they have your money you can kiss any customer service and or help resolving your issue goodbye we used them to travel to europe and it wa the worst experience i have had with an airline in year when you work hard and save your money to travel you expect a good experience welp not with this company who i am sure make million on customer per year i understand that sometimes thing happen but this started right after we booked our flight and the bad experience did not end until we set foot back to our hometown please take note the customer service number is buried on the internet and not listed on their website i had to google it and still got the run around when someone finally answered trust me the number is a secret when you finally find a customer service number there is a long wait and when or if someone answer they will not resolve your issue instead they pas the buck to whatever airline that they sold your ticket to no one take ownership what airline operates day a year and around the clock but doesn t have customer service rep to help you the customer british airway that s who they will cancel your flight without notice and not notify you at all no email no text if you are not the primary on your ticket you will get no notification or even if you are the primary you may or may not get notification if you pay for seat and you pick them it doesn t matter they will cancel your seat and not refund your money and then play stupid the flight may be cheaper but it is not once you are done paying for seat they will route to another partner airline and not notify you if you have a connecting flight they will cancel one leg and not the other and not notify you i will never use them again and if this review help one person that heed my advice then my job is done,negative

the ba first lounge at terminal wa a zoo at pm dirty table and used tableware everywhere worse than this the usual atrocious boarding gate service and boarding started min late the flight wa operated by a finnair a which is barely low cost standard let alone business class hard thin uncomfortable seat poor legroom and the cabin wa simply tatty i remain shocked that ba allow this and it s time for ba s ceo and management focused on standard rather than bean counting finnair cabin staff were fundamentally courteous but they provide a very trimmed down budget airline type service a the whole trip turned out to be and yet this business class ticket wa one of the more expensive on recent trip i thought post covid that ba were better for a few month but with the many cost cut they are making they fall well below all other european full service airline,negative
paid a quick visit to nice yesterday from heathrow decided to go business class since my last short haul flight in economy wa a real crush and rather unpleasant i paid over for a business class round trip i went into the to ba lounge in terminal which wa very crowded being in the morning i decided against having a drink and stuck to the breakfast offering the cooked option did not look that appealing but the fresh fruit selection wa very enjoyable we subsequently discovered a much nicer ba lounge closer to the gate b and waited there for min boarding wa efficient and we got ourselves seated in a and c seat b wa blocked out which acted a an additional table there did not seem to be any difference in the width of the seat from the cramped seating in economy but there may have been an additional inch of leg room i think that ba are trying to outdo easyjet in term on no frill it would not cost ba that much to supply business class passenger with a complimentary newspaper to read during the flight the inflight magazine is no longer available there are no screen so there wa zero in term of in flight entertainment the inflight wifi wa flaky at best and non existent at other time i wa glad it wa only a two hour flight i really do not think the fare that we paid wa worth the money,positive
word fail to describe this last awful flight baby across the aisle cry for most of the flight and although horrible to go without any rest for the long flight lhr sfo it s understandable for a baby to cry nonstop but the crew yakking loudly in the galley even after a polite notification that their conversation could be heard in the cabin that made the flight unbearable for any rest or sleep always difficult anyway westbound the food wa so bad that most turned down whatever the nasty offering wa on the nd service what happened to the really nice tea and scone i ve said this before after suffering through the ba concept of customer service i e don t do anything to help the passenger if it involves any extra work this time i swear i mean it never again on ba please the lounge wa so packed even a single traveler had a hard time finding a seat poor ba is on the skid downhill,negative
absolutely terrible experience the app would not let me check in online and repeatedly asked for covid document but then did not accept them even when provided i wa trying to fly back to the usa where i am a citizen and the app caused repeated error i went to british airway customer service to check in and wa told that my seat wa already given away to another passenger even though i wa there in plenty of time this wa also during an industrial action at heathrow meaning the number of flight were limited i wa delayed over hour in returning to the usa all because of their terrible app and then bad customer service that give away seat even when the paid passenger is already there at the airport,negative

the flight were all on time except belfast from london which never is the staff were efficient my issue is the app i could not book seat to tel aviv though tried for a month a wanted to pay so ended up in a middle seat even though a window seat wa available on the flight the seat wa in front of the dividing barrier and wa used a thoroughfare by the service team throughout the flight so i wasted my money on pe seat you can get hold of ba customer service via the app either and they have just ignored all other communication so just won t use them again,negative
only the second time flying ba a first time wasn t positive could have made my connection in heathrow if ba had been proactive instead overnight at the renaissance hotel compliment of ba adequate but one wonder why a large part of this hotel is devoted to sleeping and feeding of hundred of stranded passenger if ba had offered one employee to help u get to our gate instead of waiting for the shuttle bus which wa a half hour late arriving we could have made our flight and saved ba the cost of rebooking hotel shuttle food accommodation another bad show business class fare should offer more,positive
i wasn t going to bother reviewing this flight a i seem to be on a perpetual downer with ba but the airport experience convinced me otherwise after having our flight class reduced from first to business then offered an alternative route on the outward leg in first to make up for the disappointment they then reneged on this a it wa a special anniversary it sucked flying back we checked in online to our chosen window seat at the gate we had to show our passport a we passport before boarding a we were hand luggage only trying to board we had our passport checked twice more and were issued new boarding card for centre seat unbelievable the flight itself wa very quiet and only half the normal crew for this aircraft wa unavailable this meant no pre departure drink and a limited selection of food the crew wa great but what an earth is going on at ba they have this unique knack to snatch defeat from the jaw of victory every time i say this a the new club suite are great,positive
i booked business class ticket for my fianc and i i had to reschedule my flight due to an unforeseen timing change so i called to get have my flight refunded the representative on the phone informed me he wasn t sure how much i would get a the refund department needed to check but estimated i would lose of my booking to fee i accepted i never got a cancellation email or any update but instead received total back less than of my booking cost since then i have spent over hour calling different department before they blocked me i ve lost a tremendous amount of money with nothing to show,negative
i will never travel with british airway again i spent over on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the uk first the boeing cabin ha seat across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy the seat are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half they have squeezed these seat in which mean that some passenger bump their head into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet which wake up that passenger the whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you second the food wa disgusting third the service terrible fourth the toilet wa tiny fifth the inflight screen wa fixed and too high so i could not see anything sixth their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi wa waiting for hour and i had to pay more no free airport transfer with british airway seventh the charging point did not work the second leg to london wa on a larger plane with seat across the aisle that wa bearable because no hopping over people but the seat wa very uncomfortable because it wa not one piece this mean that you are sleeping on a metal bar the seat where there is a gap in the seat to add insult to injury i now find that both flight back to sydney are on the small plane to book a seat before check in is i paid it but note that there were only seat left this is why i got the worst seat in the house going out this is the most appalling airline service i have ever encountered there is no point paying for business class in british airway,negative
i am already in portugal so contacted them today and they cancelled my return flight because i wa minute late calling them even though i tried for hour to get through the day before now i am unable to get back and they have kept the pound customer service is shocking they have no intention of helping you,negative
terrible avoid this airline it s now becoming regular practice to cancel flight had a cancellation from switzerland that forced u to spend the whole night in a cheap hotel and had to fly out the next day and then had another cancellation to spain the airline only know how to ask for expensive price,negative
despite being a gold member the british airway staff in heathrow literally could not care in the slightest about the absolute turmoil and logistical damage or wider impact of their terrible service all the staff member repeat the same mantra we are not obliged to provide even an update for the first hour a if that would make the situation better there are no proactive update no empathy no care but a lot of actual lie being told you can tell that they have given up any care or thought for the passenger a actual individual they show this in every action and word they say all of them are better suited to working away from other human,negative
regarding the aircraft and seat the business class seat on this flight were pretty good all were of the suite type where every seat ha it own booth with sliding door for extra privacy the downside to this is that if you are travelling a a couple it quite difficult to interact there is ample storage and usb charging port the seat is pretty comfortable a someone who find it very difficult to sleep on flight this wa one of the only time i ve been able to get a few minute sleep here and there the amenity provided are pretty average when compared to other airline the leather toiletry bag wa quite nice though no slipper only a pair of sock the restroom on the flight are very small and don t provide much in the way of toiletry compared to other airline no free wi fi in business class is not acceptable another example of ba s penny pinching in recent year regarding the staff and customer service poor inattentive beyond meal time there wa offer of water during the flight i had to go and find an attendant and ask there wa also no offer of any snack rude at time my partner asked for a fork to be replaced a the one provided wa quite clearly dirty the attendant wa incredibly rude in response this left u shocked different customer seem to receive a different quality of service a customer behind me wa repeatedly greeted politely by name and asked how they were whether they needed anything etc whereas my partner and i were not afforded the same level of personal service this is disappointing a we paid the same price for the ticket so expect the same level of service the food wa pretty bad i had risotto while my partner had chicken both were extremely over cooked and the rice looked like porridge the vegetable were discoloured and flavourless the bread wa nice though the breakfast wasn t much better summary ba ha become the ryanair of long haul the customer service is way below what i would expect for a premium airline in a premium seat you pay a premium price for a very average service if there are other option available i would choose them over ba these day,positive
i travelled with british airway from sweden to los angeles via london in december when i arrived at lax one of my bag were missing there wa no information of the whereabouts of my bag and after searching for someone for about minute i found the point of contact and she told me my bag wa left behind i gave her my detail of where i would be staying and she told me that they would contact me after a few day and still no contact i tried to call british airway customer service the woman at the airport didn t give me a file reference number so it wa quite difficult to try and locate my bag but they finally found the reference number and my bag and said it would be delivered in a couple of day i told them that i had switched hotel and gave them the address for where i wa staying and everything wa fine but then a couple of week went by and my bag wa still nowhere to be seen and it wa time for me to fly home at the airport i tried to talk with the personnel there to try and locate my bag and they said that it wa delivered to the first hotel i stayed at even though i had given them an updated address i asked them what i should to since i wa flying home now the guy at the counter told me that it wasn t his problem and that i should figure it out myself i questioned him about his response and he just walked away a manager saw that and came up to me and apologized for his colleague and that they would send someone to fetch my bag and send it with either my flight or the next one i came home and a couple of day later i received my bag i made a complaint and claim on british airway website since i had to buy clothes and toiletry during my vacation because i didn t have my bag in january they said that they would refund me for my claim it is now april almost may and i have still not received the refund even after multiple email conversation i don t know what to do anymore about this situation since it appears that no one is willing to help me i am appalled about how the situation is being handled and frankly disappointed at british airway and the lack of customer service,negative
food wa lousy who ever is planning the asian hindu vegetarian meal is clueless a to what this meal includes the snack wa also lousy it took u hour just to go from t to t and clear security check the place wa chaotic we get to our boarding gate and again a long line with minute wait for someone to check passport and boarding pas seat in premium economy wa ok but when the passenger in front reclines there is very little space for the window seat passenger to cross over overall not a good airline,negative
had the worst experience the flight from london to toronto got delayed and we missed the connecting flight to halifax we were four including an infant and a toddler aged year despite being delayed and missed the connecting flight the ground staff were not at all helpful we waited for an hour to get them to talk to u and at am they told u they have not booked any hotel for u to stay that night and asked to go search for a hotel on your own very nice of you british airway at least you guy should have given some consideration to the traveler who travel with child and booked some accommodation we will not to travel on this airline again,negative
the ground staff were not helpful felt like all they wanted to do wa rush u to check in and then all passenger needed up waiting in a holding area for a bus anyway travelling with a child with a disability wa a nightmare with british airway logged a complaint and it took almost four week to answer lost some of our luggage it wa not a good experience,negative
second time ba premium economy in a newer aircraft and yet another excellent experience despite a three hour delay and missing my connection in hong kong this wa a very pleasant flight seat are spacious and comfortable in premium economy in this layout attitude of the cabin crew wa excellent and food wa good they communicate well and rebooked my connection during the flight which brought peace of mind a very pleasant experience in ba premium economy after a major disappointment in club world earlier this year,positive
they changed our flight from brussels to london heathrow to lax on we paid extra to choose our seat since they cancelled they never honored the seat that we bought they seated u in totally different seat i asked the check in employee she wa very rude and told u that we have to understand that wa a different flight from london to lax wa worse nobody in the airport help u employee from ba told u that we have to return next day for our flight we can rent a hotel or go terminal and sleep there finally one employee help u and give a voucher for hotel it wa a nightmare this airline we missed one day work and ba didn t return the money that we paid for our previous chosen seat,negative
at copenhagen the most chaotic ticket counter assignment in the history of airline time on board never changed no fixed counter at airport abysmal service that need vast improvement here,positive
worst experience of my life trying to deal with the customer service for british airway so many issue with getting from one destination to the other had an absolutely horrible time trying to get answer or reach anyone who wa capable of helping navigate uncertainty i wrote them a formal complaint requesting some type of refund and received a generic we are sorry email with avios attached which is equivalent to maybe on a flight needless to say these will go to waste a i refuse to fly with an untrustworthy incompetent unorganized airline that couldn t even address one single issue expressed to them it wa equivalent to handing me a band aid after slapping me in the face i will say the flight itself wa smooth and the onboard staff wa kind and attentive the most frustrating thing is that the customer service is trained to give you the runaround so heavily to the point of exhaustion that you just give up trying and take the loss,negative
due to code sharing with cathay pacific i wa downgraded to ba on my return leg i can t describe how cheated i felt i booked and paid for an airline with great entertainment food and service instead i wa forced to go hungry because they only had one choice of meal and it wa inedible to ensure the passenger didn t get any funny idea and assume that a the vegetarian option wa unavailable they might be given a cracker or a small packet of nut the cabin crew announced in their uniquely aggressive and dismissive way you won t get anything else for hour you know the entertainment is compiled mainly of b movie so i paid for wi fi so i could watch netflix on my laptop unsurprisingly the signal wa so weak i couldn t even send an email to add insult to injury the earbuds provided the cheapest and lowest quality i have ever seen since the last time i used this airline the crew are less rude and obnoxious and are now just impatient and unhelpful what i don t understand is why it seems that british airway look for these characteristic a desirable attribute for their crew,negative
lhr check in wa quick at the first wing and quickly through security the first lounge wa quiet for a change and a reasonably good breakfast buffet available while ba have brought back their highlife magazine in the lounge it seems they used covid to scrap all the other magazine they used to offer a part of the endless ba cost cutting the toilet in the lounge were a disgusting a ever not cleaned frequently on this visit and they are about year out of date the public washroom in t are better and cleaner boarding wa the usual ba muddled mess and two of the gate staff appeared to have no clue what they were doing endless announcement at the gate about being a full flight requesting passenger to check in bag only to get on a flight that wa less than full onboard a very good welcome from captain and the flight left the gate only min late breakfast had choice and wa a fair standard no hot towel or even packet towel offered in club europe any more another part of the relentless ba cost cutting i wouldn t mind but fare are proportionately a lot higher now than pre covid cabin staff service wa perfunctory at best not a scrap of recognition for ba gold or oneworld emerald member clear proof that ba really don t care any more breakfast tray cleared min into the flight and that wa the sign for staff to stay in the front galley for the rest of the flight paid for hour wifi and dropped connection for the next min sad to note that staff service on ryanair is more pro active nowadays priority tagged suitcase came out nearly last at malaga this is standard for ba business class baggage handling do not waste your money on club europe standard just keep dropping,positive
i wouldn t recommend british airway at all i tried to call to customer service for time in different day and time and i waited for more than minute on the phone i ended hanging up they are excusing themselves in the high volume of call i write an email an i am still waiting for week website is difficult to navigate it is not easy really to have an invoice of proof of receipt or look for another service they sent you online but you don t receive a pdf file so if you need a proof of flight you need to do screenshots and once the flight is flown you have no access to that booking again to reprint any document or try to create a pdf you need to contact with a customer service which i did it online long waiting time and had to wait more than a week to receive it expensive and poor almost inexistent customer service and difficult to use their website an airline that definitely wouldn t recommend it is such a shame that in they are still in this position and sleeping when they have competitor around,negative
absolutely horrible experience i booked a ticket from expedia for a british airway operated flight from madrid to belfast with a changeover at london heathrow the whole itinerary wa listed a ba although the madrid to london flight wa iberia on jan nd london wa experiencing cold and fog the iberian flight sat on the tarmac for hour in madrid because of the london weather upon landing in terminal i had to take a bus to terminal the flight wa the last flight to belfast for the evening and it had already taken off the ba desk wa swamped with people a many people had to spend the night due to the weather the british airway staff said that we could go book any hotel up to pound and we would be reimbursed i wa barely able to find a room and had to take an expensive cab however when trying to get the reimbursement ba said it wasn t their problem and that it wa iberia s problem iberia said they do not reimburse due to the weather when complaining to ba they said they only market the flight a ba and that they refuse to reimburse absolutely disgusting behavior by the airline to not take any responsibility for a flight that they were using their name to sell it to people but don t want to take responsibility for it did they expect me to take the bus back to terminal their people gave out false information,negative
this is the worst airline not one thing went right i don t understand how they have got it so bad late take off no gate when we arrived bag took over minute to arrive horrendous,negative
i will never fly british airway again to start the plane wa over hour late with no weather and no reason given the boarding process wa chaotic both in the airport and onto the plane but more importantly although we were in business class it wasn t really business class there were a few aisle not separated in any way in which they simply put a tray on the middle seat so that no one sits there and those seat like the rest were extremely cramped and uncomfortable i could not believe they called this business class,negative
worst aircraft i have ever flown the seat were cramped and uncomfortable considering the flight cost well over each we expected a little space for the money my husband knee were rubbing on seat in front which for a hour flight is not acceptable my food wa disgusting and inedible both the hot food and the breakfast were vile i would not entertain using ba again ground staff were great it s the seating and food on offer that let the airline down we expected so much more,negative
i enjoyed my flight the boarding wa swift and service wa very friendly and professional the food selection wa good and i enjoyed the quality the wa only one downside when we landed there wa an issue with ground crew not being ready at t so in total from landing to getting the door open it took minute i believe the heathrow t were having strike action that week,positive
why do you make it so hard after a so so lounge experience the staff taking care of boarding treated u with disdain bordering contempt it can t be training who would do that it ha to be no fear of anything happening the new club world suite are a huge step up from the old product and really on deliver comfort and privacy the crew were professional but i personally found the food menu rather odd essentially there wa one only main that i could handle and wa then told they had ran out i wa a few row in,negative
after several delay and canceled flight we finally made it to copenhagen on american airline and british airway flight my luggage wa destroyed wheel torn off i had to buy new luggage in denmark i made a claim with british airway to reimburse me but because i didn t have the receipt for my old luggage they would only cover of my new luggage advice have receipt for your old luggage prior to flying so you don t get ripped off like i did,negative
literally the worst flight of my life after booking ticket together with my partner we were then separated sorry the flight is full the flight then took off minute late no apology the trolley service took over two hour and they periodically skipped row and the response wa flippant and rude whoop not sure how that happened what do you want genuinely appalling from beginning to end might a well fly easy jet at least they charge a price commensurate with the poor quality of service not like ba,negative
i swore i would never fly ba again after they messed me about so much when trying to get to budapest but the time for their flight suited me so i decided to give them another go the flight left on time just about the cabin wa clean and the staff friendly there wa even complimentary tea coffee and a breakfast bar to be had for economy the flight wa pleasant enough and i can t think of any negative to write about the flight and service wa certainly head and shoulder above my trip with easyjet,positive
obviously many airline have gone downhill in recent year price have increased and service have gone down the most disappointing thing about ba is that aspect that really don t need to get worse have the check in staff at heathrow are downright rude and abusive shouting at passenger to line here and there and rolling their eye if passenger get confused with the constant shouting and bullying airline are now competing globally more and more and this behaviour is particularly noticeable in asia where the service industry is next level i wouldn t want to suggest that all the staff are like this and many younger employee are polite and helpful however there were a couple of older staff that were downright rude and obnoxious,negative
lost out of checked bag denied wheelchair assistance at lhr for my wife and the staff forced u to change terminal by foot rude staff on ba from lhr to ord on april ignored multiple time when simply requested a cup of water when walked up to them after a couple of attempt to request for water politely the ba staff onboard yelled at my wife and asked her to be go back to seat horrible flight with disappointing staff customer service is terrible and online check in never worked because ba never verified our covid document which were uploaded in advance resulting me and my wife seated separately i ve lost respect for british airway disgusted,negative
i have flown with ba for many year and there wa a time about year ago when they were getting better sadly this trip underline how they have slipped versus other airline at booking time one is scammed an extortionate amount to book a seat at heathrow t check in the queue were unbelievably long and staff at bag drop curt to say the least the lounge here remain awful and overcrowded and ba ha not invested in them for many year on the flight the food wa okay although portion are kept minimal this wa one of those day when the crew could not give a damn and the service wa mostly absent for the entire flight next time they change ceo can they not do better than recruiting from aa second rate budget irish airline,positive
boarding at mumbai wa chaotic and badly organised once on board the crew announcement were professional relaxed and informative in typical ba style the seat wa quite comfortable it wa a refurbished aircraft and the padding and material are quite good i wa lucky that the middle seat wa empty so i didn t suffer from the new narrow seat which i think would have made it a lot less comfortable the ife is excellent responsive and good quality there is an enormous selection of tv and movie and a good number of game wifi is also very good not quite netflix quality but still reasonable and i don t think for full flight is bad value you can pay less if you just want short term simple messaging cabin crew were very good friendly and efficient catering wa reasonable although on a near hr flight the small but tasty pastry for the second meal service wasn t really enough landing and processing at heathrow wa astonishingly quick it felt like it wa am even though it wa pm no queue or waiting at all even the baggage wa super quick at coming through overall a very solid experience in economy significantly better than it used to be,positive
mexico city airport is a zoo but taking the late departure on ba to lhr isn t too bad club passenger can use the aa admiral lounge which is surprisingly good and not too busy a it seems to cater to ba s club passenger only at this time of day lovely staff solid food bar really pleasant we flew an older with the old style club seat seated in the front cabin just row of club in the window and adjecant aisle seat is really good if you travel with your partner come to think of it i will really miss this old style once cutting edge lay out there is no better way to fly when you are a couple we were in that last row of the front cabin so both window and aisle seat had unobstructed access to the aisle still terrible you have to pay for these seat but it obvioulsy work and we were happy getting these seat flying ba when the crew is good is amazing service wa impecable on this flight just the right mix of humor service and attention food seemed to be good a well but hardly touched it i am fine sleeping in these old club world seat although bedding could be better on time departure smooth flight and early arrival at heathrow we went outside for a smoke and returned to the terminal through fast track security at lhr ha always been terrible but today security staff wa too busy chatting among themselves so all bag went through without secundary check we had a lovely shower at the spa what a fabulous facility the south lounge wa crazy busy and it is just a design disaster who ever choose the bizarre combination of furniture what a mess food on offer wa solid and so are the drink our home stretch to amsterdam wa pretty straight forward lousy welcome at the door but crew recovered well and made everyone feel special with excellent bar cart service i love the double serving of drink english tea is about the worst meal concept in the world and i really don t understand ba stuck to it through the year no one like the cucumber white bread thing but hey on time landing in amsterdam but the usual long taxi then clumsy jet bridge connection ended up with a minute late arrival why is it so hard to connect a jetbridge in amsterdam flying club in ba is still wonderful i love it,positive

generally poor sent to gate on time sat maybe minute wa then announced a crew were not familiar with the a there would be a delay clearly nonsense and there wa a retraction on board of this statement watched the crew walk through to the gate my impression wa they did not want to be there wa given a miniscule amount of water small bag of pretzel and then it wa announced there would be a wait for any further cabin service a card processing machine were u s no further update or sight of crew for next two hour then attempted to charge u for even a glass of water when i said this should be complimentary girl said it wa not her problem and walked away,negative

i wa horrified by the extremely small seat and the poor training that the crew clearly receives not one of them exuded any kind of warmth or expressed any desire to make our journey pleasant the seat were so narrow that regardless of the size of your neighbor you are forced to touch each other constantly if the seat in front of you is reclined you have no choice but to recline your own or else you are breathing in the head scalp of the person in front of you food wa revolting they don t even provide napkin unless you ask with the pre meal drink and the secondary meal the last time i flew ba it wa a completely other experience and i wa so sorry to see how far the quality level ha slid it wa really majorly disappointing and i regret that i have already purchased other intercontinental trip with the company i will now have to see if i can change them the pathetic ml bottle of water it s just a sip on the shorter flight the seat couldn t even be reclined which wa a great pity since the flight wa delayed by almost hour and we had to wait on board,negative

our flight out to dubrovnik wa at the painful time of in the morning and from london gatwick not an easy airport to get to at that hour especially a you have to be at the airport minimum hr before to be ready to board i understand why the like of easyjet ryanair or wizzair fly at very odd time to utilise cheaper slot at airport but it seems an odd choice for ba given most people like u who fly with them choose them based on quality not on price alone outbound lgw dbv boarding wa fairly quick easy and efficient and we took off on time pilot announcement clear professional and inspired confidence which is something i appreciate and expect of ba pilot aircraft wa clean and it had not been through the recent refurbishment program yet so had the advantage of having the pinnacle seat in economy still with more padding and adjustable winged headrest for better comfort complimentary harrogate mineral water given a usual which is a premium touch complimentary snack of a nutrigain bar wa poor and not premium however cabin crew felt very unpolished in both presentation and behaviour messy ill fitting uniform and unclassy make up toilet clean and maintained appreciate anti bacterial wipe being kept available post covid inbound dbv lgw for some reason no online or app check in available despite dubrovnik airport being a very modern airport with state of the art facility no queue at manual check in though and ground staff were very warm friendly and helpful pro actively offered to take our larger hand luggage into hold free of charge but we decided to keep with u a we would have to dash for train home from airport and train on the other end were being cancelled already we did not understand the delay to our flight a the inbound flight for that day had took off on time and landed on time also we travelled to dubrovnik out of season and the airport wa empty at that hour with all service being available solely for this flight taking off that evening all the passenger in the terminal at that time including u were there to take this flight we boarded on time and then we all sat at the gate for minute for no reason it s truly bizarre how ba managed to take off late when all the service at the airport were operating and live solely for the purpose of enabling this flight to take off pilot for this flight were unpolished with unclear announcement during the flight one couldn t even remember where we flying back to no apology for delay cabin crew a bit smarter presented and seemed more approachable harrogate water given out and the world tiniest bag of pretzel complimentary seat for this flight were horrendous and the new slimline one ba are installing from row onwards these seat have barely any padding so very hard and also have no headrest so very hard to get comfortable we landed minute late in gatwick and again no apology wa given we were lucky to catch the last uncanceled train home otherwise we d been stranded for hour we d spent half an hour circling gatwick because we missed our original landing slot given because in the context of the short haul market thats what they deserve we fly ba a we don t fly the low cost carrier after so many bad experience but it s by no measure good just the least bad option given point extra solely for giving something complimentary onboard,positive

we were flying world traveller plus their premium service what it wa not wa premium we have travelled with many airline and lucky enough to fly premium most time ba s premium is the worst i have come across the flight from heathrow to jfk wa just ok the flight back wa in a plane that should not be used old dirty uncomfortable with two broken seat out of the four we had one would not recline and one reclined without using the button ba need to look at the premium service and offer exactly that instead of trying to cut cost they have fallen far behind their competitor they were once my preferred airline but now i try and avoid at all cost i would rather pay more and fly with someone else,negative
this wa literally one of the worst experience i haven t been to an airport since it began in orlando flying back the flight plan system went down and we were stuck on the tarmac for hour poor customer service and just ignored at time then missed my connecting flight and we were told not to leave the baggage area without our bag even though i booked through to dublin another hour i wa told my bag were lost and to continue to the desk to book a flight another hour later i wa handed a card with a number and told to ring it i wa cut off three time and told i wouldn t be able to get home that day despite several flight being available just booked my own flight and had lost my suit and present for christmas and missed an engagement party,negative
the usual shambolic unfolding that ba ha now unfortunately been come to known for we had a long weekend flight booked to munich that wa supposed to be departing on th february at this happened to be our first flight with our newborn month old daughter it turned out to be a horror show of incompetence just under hr before scheduled departure the original th february flight wa cancelled we received an email a we were boarding the heathrow express i d booked a day of holiday off work for this trip we ended up getting doing a round trip to paddington instead on the way back from the cancelled flight both me and my wife tried calling ba despite one of u having silver membership possibly the largest joke of a membership currently out there i took u nearly minute to speak to someone who could help i believe ba outsource their call centre and so you end up talking to people who are following a script the result is that you might a well be speaking to an ai rather than a human we often received the response similar to computer say no if this is the service level for silver member i can t imagine what a regular punter ha to put up with when the phone originally connected to a person i had to wait minute a his computer booted up ba then proceeded to auto book u onto a new flight for the next day but going to a different destination our original flight wa to munich and the auto booked replacement flight wa to salzburg when asking the robot at the ba call centre why they booked u on a replacement flight to a location km apart they couldn t understand my frustration eventually someone wa able to book u onto a flight the following day at not ideal a i d wasted a valuable day off work and the hotel wouldn t refund u or move our booking but at least we were going to munich and not salzburg the day of the new flight came round and this time we managed to get all the way to the check in desk upon arriving at the check in desk we were told that our rebooked flight had just been cancelled minute earlier no email no text no notification ever arrived from ba to tell u that the flight had been cancelled incomprehensible a to how this could have possibly happened the check in person said i should get on the app to rebook at this point i didn t know whether to explode with anger or cry luckily another check in person had an ounce of sympathy and explained to the useless check in person that he could actually rebook u we were booked onto another flight later that evening ba unfortunately that meant hr in the grotty lounge with a month old baby it appears that everyone now ha access to a lounge and so there s really no difference between the lounge and a hostel other than you get free stuff in the former this wa not a pleasant experience we did eventually arrive in munich and despite asking didn t get our push chair stroller delivered to the front of the plane the plane wa a characteristically ba dumping ground they used to give you sanitising wipe so you could clean your seat and tray table down but they seemed to have cut back on this service too all in all another shocking ba service a lost day of holiday and not an an ounce of empathy sympathy understanding at all from any of the employee i interacted with,negative

very competent check in staff saw had a problem with my left arm and insisted i could not take exit seat moved me to row where the middle seat wa empty on the other hand on board huge line for toilet min into a min flight a crew member realised one of the toilet is closed a crew had put their luggage there they announced that they could not serve hot drink on this flight and to bear with them a service will be slow on asking why they did not give u enough cup for hot drink and the card machine is not working so we have to fill out each credit card slip a bottle of water and a nutrigrain bar,positive
check in wa so slow no self check in and bag drop boarding wa ok flight totally full booked row which wa ok some space in overhead bin seat and legroom ok cabin crew ok smiled gave out the bottle of water and pretzel flight itself wa ok landed min early and then waited minute for a stand and ground crew bag came off reasonably quickly ba still seems to believe it is something special a premium carrier the reality is that it is not the only reason we flew ba wa we got virtually free ticket because both flight were cancelled last year ba is our carrier of last choice,positive
my review relates to the appalling experience i had with british airway on th february i wa due to travel to madrid with british airway and before setting off i heard on the radio that there were flight delay i looked at the heathrow airport website and saw that my flight had been cancelled a a result of the information on the website i called british airway and have minute on hold i found myself speaking to somebody in a call centre in south africa the person wa hard to understand due to a heavy accent and he wa incompetent and insisted that the flight wa not cancelled i made my way to heathrow and sure enough the flight wa indeed cancelled the woman in question had the audacity to declare that the flight wa cancelled and that there are no facility here at the airport to rebook you she refused to let me and about other people join the queue for the clearly marked assistance desk the same woman and one of her colleague gave out a card with a telephone number and told one rather elderly gentleman to go online to rebook your seat i am visually impaired and found the attitude of the ba employee to be appalling i called the number on the card the employee gave me and wa again in a long queue to a call centre the person who picked up the phone kept me waiting minute and declared that the flight wa not cancelled and that the airport must be wrong he then in a flippant tone said he wa just informed that the flight wa indeed cancelled and that i would have to go and speak to iberia customer service in heathrow to rebook i took the elderly gentleman with me to iberia where the counter staff member rolled her eye in disgust and said that it wa nothing to do with iberia i returned to ba and this time i joined the check in line and told a check in agent what had happened the man in question booked me onto the next available flight within a matter of a few minute he gave me a voucher a a form of compensation but said he could not add my frequent flyer number with a partner airline the voucher proved useless i am afraid a various shop in the predepature area refused to accept it and although i wa told i could use it after clearing security none of the shop would accept it once aboard my new flight the service wa minimal other than a tiny bottle of water and a packet of pretzel nothing else wa available this wa a full flight a so many people had been transferred from the cancelled flight ba cabin crew announced that any additional item other than the small bottle of water and pretzel had to be ordered via their skyshop,negative

outward journey ba london to buenos aire club world january our experience wa poor from beginning to end although we had reserved seat f and j another passenger wa occupying f and crew made no attempt to address the problem eventually i persuaded the passenger to move and occupy her designated seat d we boarded punctually but were not offered drink when i asked for a drink the crew member said it wa too late and blamed the seating problem the same crew member then began taking order for dinner but did not write them all down and gave up after a few minute for the safety briefing she asked u to repeat our order later the hot flannel smelled musty and felt old and ragged one of the crew wondered aloud whether my companion and i were related my soup wa cold i wa told it wa served from flask wa that an explanation or an excuse my coffee wa weak and tasted like instant granule my companion wa initially served no bread roll with dinner the breakfast menu stated a selection of roll pastry but there wa no choice and my companion wa given a dried fruit pastry where he would have chosen a bread roll although we had not previously asked for or been offered any other than those supplied at the seat small bottle of water ran out return journey ba buenos aire to london heathrow world traveller plus january wa a huge contrast from the warm welcome on boarding to crew s professionalism throughout it s a poor reflection on club world service that our experience in world traveller plus wa so much better and kinder weighed against the advantage of a flat bed the considerable price difference wa not worth paying for the catalogue of error and inconvenience outlined above,negative
check in agent at lhr wa very helpful and friendly a were the in flight crew seat wa comfortable with good leg room however the food wa poor barely better than economy class with a poor quality and limited selection of wine in flight entertainment selection we re very limited far inferior to what ba used to offer overall this premium economy product wa disappointing and very poor value for money,positive

excellent service both on the ground and on board while their first class product might not be leading edge the service around the entire experience wa well worth the cost of the ticket the concorde room at heathrow is well managed and a great place to relax prior to the trip flight wa slightly delayed out of heathrow but arrived on schedule in johannesburg,positive
good lounge at cape town on time departure drink high quality sound dinner service breakfast reasonable arrival lounge wa good but shower cold,positive
a really excellent journey lounge not overcrowded in late afternoon plenty of edible food easy boarding new club world suite great and compared to when we last travelled in them a year ago food and drink back to previous standard choice of individual wine rather than bland blend course served individually with cut glass and china beef cheek really tasty a wa a surprisingly good soup crew excellent good choice of movie breakfast after a good night s sleep fruit etc first couldn t manage the full english which wa offered arrival on time what more could you want not quite up to gulf standard overall but ba seems to have eventually got it business class back to standard,positive
this flight wa one of the worst i have ever had in my life i wanted to pamper myself so i bought business class i wa looking forward to my new experience i will not mention the chaos of changing gate several time a these thing may happen what surprised me wa the lack of attention to passenger the flight wa delayed by almost hour even though staff offered voucher we had no idea where to get them and we were told that we only had about minute to use them because boarding had already begun firstly i did not see anyone with the voucher and secondly even if we got it we were not able to use it when i finally got to the airport there wa another waiting for about minute after cross check meantime we were told that due to problem they did not load any food so the flight will be without any food on board the only food offered and given to everyone on the plane wa a small bag of nut a a business class passenger i wa offered drink only all in all my business class contained small glass of juice i received no apology or compensation from the company at all it wa a disgraceful and cheap service for a very expensive price,negative
it seems that there is a race to the bottom amongst airline i cannot even check in because ba requires the submission of document for covid restriction however the form to start the submission process is hopelessly broken after clicking submit the form just hang forever no error message is given i tried three different browser on three different device all have the same hang which mean you cannot check in online nor can you select a seat i tried using the chat bot but after minute of clicking try again i thought i had donated enough time to ba,negative

being a silver flyer and booking a flight through ba to dublin you would have thought i could use the lounge even though ba used air lingus for the flight travelled recently there with the same situation and wa allowed in by a kind gentleman at the desk even though he said i had to be gold he wa really accommodating and it wasn t a big deal but the two lady on the desk were like no no empathy there at all saying the other guy shouldn t have let me and they will have a word with him come on ba i booked the flight through you and you made me fly with air lingus so you should let me use the lounge a a silver flier,negative
i find ba incredibly tacky and constantly looking for way to get money out of customer i have travelled using major airline my whole life and although i know it sound silly when on a hour flight on a major airline you do expect some form of beverage or snack a a curtesy and a port to charge your phone and not have to pay insane price for luggage there wa no inflight entertainment and the aircraft wa very snug when i challenged why i had to pay for my own drink and why no inflight entertainment i wa told it wa a short haul fight my sister met me from cairo which is an hour and half flight and flew egyptair and somehow received luggage allowance drink food and inflight entertainment a well a a usb port to charge their phone ba i now realise stand for budget airline staff were great what you got for your money not so much,positive

great thing about british airway a is the economy section upstairs get this if you can a it allows you to have small stowage cupboard at the window seat despite being not very old the a looked tired inside broken side stowage a seat that reclined uncontrollably and slow to react ife the food wa supposed to be christmas dinner wafer thin bit of dry turkey over cooked sprout and some cubed potato poor in taste and quality mousse desert wa great though slight issue during the snack meal ordered a child option which wa marked a such regular meal arrived a well and they were exactly the same asked a crew member to be told the difference wa the sticker on the box staff were ok couple decent but mostly just ok overall ba just seems a tad cheap these day great to sit upstairs but that wa where the enjoyment ended just seemed a bit dull and like ba are just an average airline,positive
the staff are friendly the plane wa cold we were shivering they gave light blanket but they were not enough meal were basic entertainment wa basic luggage is delayed today is day and ba staff over the phone say call after hour tracking system is very vague had to extract information from staff that they arrived to vancouver on jan nd i offered to collect baggage but very vague answer call the airport asked her for ba phone number at yvr but she said we don t have a phone number for you to call call the main airport their policy state you can make a claim only after day,positive
probably the worst business class experience i ve ever had on an airline just a few of the issue required to purchase seat on international club world business class this wa not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional on a single leg lhr lax for a family of four given the very strange business class seating layout on ba a s leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family ridiculously long boarding time on even small aircraft on my vie lhr leg the boarding time for the a wa over minute long leading to a delayed departure there wa no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding time severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite c of terminal at heathrow boarding staff would not allow passenger to enter the roped off queue area before boarding i have no idea why not and so crowding wa extreme the overall boarding area wa far too small for an a and i believe this satellite wa designed and built after the first a s were delivered online check in in advance of flight appears to be completely broken i wa urged repeatedly on the ba website and via email and text to upload my covid document even though at the end of there are no covid document required for travel after i filled in basic contact information on the website and did not upload any covid documentation i wa informed several hour later that my covid document have been verified i then received another text message urging me to upload my covid documentation on the vie lhr leg the shop ba com page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight time over six hour and then four hour just before landing ba lounge for club europe and club world at heathrow are often seriously overcrowded furniture and carpeting and other finish in the club are worn or dirty that said the food in the lounge wa of pretty good quality the food quality in ba lounge at heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline onboard food and beverage service wa far below average for international business class terrible one might say on the lhr lax leg there wa no pre meal beverage service and there were no mid flight beverage service at all unlike most business class offering on other airline there wa no taking a meal order by flight attendant at the beginning of the flight meal were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off with the chicken or fish type of meal selection similar to economy class there wa no coffee or tea service after meal food quality wa poor with the pre landing snack of a ploughman s lunch being downright disgusting there wa no beverage or bar set up in the galley area beverage available to passenger during the flight a is standard on most international business class offering even bottle of water seemed be hidden away requiring one to ask the flight attendant for water i won t comment on the bizarre seating layout on the a a others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating the seat are not long a stated on the ba website and i found the seat too short for my height the priority luggage tag were not followed in the baggage delivery,negative
definitely not recommended especially for business class the seat are ridiculous and small the food is mediocre if that and good luck with the internet even if you pay for full internet for the entire flight the service however ha been great my attendant saved me from cry i don t know who designed this aircraft but in this expensive business class in order to move out of you middle seat to go to the bathroom you must rudely climb over the person s leg sitting in the aisle seat your seat is like an enclosed tiny cubicle with no storage space i ve unfortunately traveled british airway business class at least time within the last month never again unless there is no other choice by the way the business class lounge south at heathrow is a cattle pen,negative
ba shuttle service across the uk is still surprisingly a good product when compared with ba long haul that doesn t always get the best of comment at time it s reasonable priced work well fresh crew and no queue or long distance to walk i don t know why they still offer a covid style bottle of water and snack when just stretching to a cup of tea and snack would be great add on for this service currently they have an on line sky cafe but it s too fiddly to work or get connected in short trip,positive
i must admit like many others i tend to avoid ba long haul where possible due to the many poor review but had my first ride on a ba a the other day so it wa an exception what can i say aircraft immaculate and economy seat really comfortable but that s about it ife didn t work but wasn t that interesting anyway i got the map screenshot for a while lunch wa poor quality but plenty of nice white wine and other alcoholic drink made up for it cabin crew pleasant but poor grooming let them down some skirt some trouser suit some long sleeve some short some jacket some waistcoat some cardigan on at time and all in all they could have done better i think baggage delivery wa really quick summing up well i am still not coming back to ba not yet maybe the old charm will return soon,positive
when will ba update their business class cabin across on a it is not so much travelling facing backwards a it were but the cabin staff having to pas food tray across the front of passenger paying business class fare a for having to pay to reserve a specific seat an antiquated idea the cabin staff were fine food acceptable check in ok and business lounge breakfast acceptable the lack of space in the seating area small screen and disfunctional entertainment equipment disappointing having to step over the reclining passenger foot is not attractive,positive
paid day before flight for an upgrade from economy to premium economy at checkin they could not find my booking so a little wait while they rang someone who explains on the upgrade you get deleted from the system the checkin agent see took about minute to resolve seat wa nice enough stowage pocket in front a bit small food wa reasonably nice shame that the bathroom is all the way back through economy and there is a bit of a queue ife system is good but selection mediocre worst part of the flight is that at cpt so we were on a remote stand and bussed in through passport control quickly but then it took an absolute age to get our luggage which ruined what would otherwise have been a reasonable flight upgrade wa worth it at maybe it a long flight but their offer of or whatever for premium economy is comedy pricing score before the luggage fiasco would have been or with the luggage fiasco i can t rate it more than,negative
ba website did not work weirdly deleted my flight from upcoming flight on the day of departure chaos at cape town airport with hundred queuing a the computer were down chaos at the gate no queue management for premium passenger very nice new a with smart new club suite champagne warm cabin crew said it impossible to serve it cold which is not true a air france manage it disappointing meal wine served so late after the food you have finished by the time it arrives cheese ice cold and tasteless why can t the champagne white wine be in the fridge used for the cheese good ife system but mediocre film selection disappointing breakfast overall flew air france business the month before which wa way better so sad what s become of ba,negative
absolutely terrible experience with british airway after a short flight from london heathrow to frankfurt they couldn t get my suitcase to me in time for my next flight on cathay pacific to melbourne despite a hour gap between the two flight told me they would arrange for the suitcase to be transferred directly to melbourne instead it got to hong kong and left there when they finally tracked it down they sent it back to london all happened over christmas so very stressful yet minimal communication from their team while the plane crew may be lovely the service outside of this ha been nothing short of dreadful and if given the option i will avoid flying with them in future,negative

british airway are not the flag carrier they used to be the check in staff at the club europe area did not display any premium service and did not provide a good overall service the gallery south lounge wa very busy but the food wa very good there is a good array of salad pasta bread and hot food available the festive turkey and ham pie wa particularly good the flight wa delayed a lhr wa very busy on a tuesday evening the boarding process wa stressful due to the lack of any queue management system and the majority of passenger congregating around the gate despite ba using a group system to board it took almost hr to board passenger the flight itself wa good with a good club meal service the bar service wa good but it seems that ba have done away with champagne on board and also in the lounge a menu is handed out prior to departure with a good food offering for the length of flight the food wa very good with beef cheek served with vegetable being chosen ba have always excelled with their catering and this ha not changed the seat is a standard economy seat with a table in the middle seat for club europe a standard practice for ba the seat wa comfortable but with limited leg room the cabin wa clean presentable and tidy with no issue the a featured wi fi which contains a very good landing page with flight information access to the speedbird cafe menu access to ba com and a good pricing strategy for wither just messaging or streaming also overall the airline is still a good world player but with clear improvement needed with their ground staff the cabin manager wa very good but the other crew in club did not display the expected behaviour in business class she kept touching her face not making eye contact with passenger and seemed uninterested and like she did not want to be there,negative

i ve generally been a loyal gold status flyer with ba if they fly the route i m after but my recent flight to nairobi wa about a abysmal a you can get we should have departed at but after continuous delay finally left hour late not ideal when you ve then got an hr flight staff informed u virtually a we took off that the meal and drink service would be started and completed asap a they needed to get rest because of hour we had been delayed they couldn t get it out and away quickly enough that wa then basically the last you saw of them until they came around an hour or so before landing i sincerely hope they enjoyed their rest because when you pay full fare for business class service you actually expect a service they were all extremely miserable and clearly didn t want to be on board we re still waiting for you to pay our compensation that ha been awarded to u by the official ombudsman in july for the cancellation of our flight to miami in march this wa cancelled at am for the pm flight,positive
a great flight the suite on this aircraft really provide maximum comfort british ha returned to full service so meal were coursed menu and hot towel provided etc food wa quite good with choice provided for both meal service wa ok i prefer to have the same person serving me rather than a hodge pudge but that s my preference entertainment wa good a wa connectivity no real complaint except a minor one the tray table seemed far from me while eating in it closest position i actually felt like i wa in a true business class not by qatar s standard but that s another story,positive

just a few year ago flying on ba wa enjoyable but time have changed these day about five hour on board the plane is no fun at all the terminal experience still feel classy and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient on board though it s just become an experience to be endured ba s mean decision to split seat into nicer for the first half of the plane and nastier for the rest underline this there is no entertainment no magazine refreshment purchase are brought to the seat after ordering from an app there is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day despite the competition being able to do this is it too much to ask for when trapped on board for five hour you get a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal bar on the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing but helpfully tied a bag around a toilet door down the back in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear thing up themselves recline button have been deleted on the seat and the seat pitch feel squeezed on the return flight for one reason or another due to ba s delay from the previous day we were just under two hour late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passenger couldn t travel at all because there were not enough crew the cabin crew were nonetheless distinctly more professional on this flight altogether i would say good thing if there were any but it s hard to think of anything i could recommend ba for and that is a pity because it used to be a professional company to deal with and a pleasure worth looking forward to when making european journey,positive
a very positive experience with ba seat were new style club seat and very comfortable for sleep food wa fine but not outstanding wi fi good and video screen large and bright baggage came out very quickly at heathrow had the same experience on the return flight to atlanta all in all would fly ba again but would probably want to make sure it is new seat,positive
baby across the aisle cried nonstop and crew yakked in the galley so on this long flight there wa no possibility for any sleep or even rest mentioning to a crew member that their colleague were talking loudly made no difference at all my second meal wa something inedible no way to get a simple bag of crisp or nut instead an assortment of dried something baggage took hour to be delivered and had no priority for club or even first passenger we were all kept waiting after many economy bag had been delivered a is a great aircraft but the ba seating is still the very tired old yin yang configuration with some people stuck in the middle of seat probably not what anyone is expecting in business class these day,negative
evening flight from lhr to iad on an a check in at t is poor most of their kiosk don t work well and staff have to be called boarding wa very poorly managed the ground staff were overwhelmed because it wa a full flight and were struggling to manage passenger the gate wa small and there wa insufficient seating for such a big aircraft the flight wa full and it left minute late but the pilot kept u informed on this issue once airborne service started quite quickly and the cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful they did their job very professionally and efficiently they answered the call bell promptly and nothing wa too much trouble they started out with a bar service and were generous with drink and then came the meal service and the food wa very good the ife wa old and clunky but had sufficient movie and tv programme for a hour flight the seat wa comfortable but legroom wa tight all in it wa an uneventful journey and i would give it the thumb up but ground service need attention,positive
we boarded our flight at edinburgh to london for our connecting flight to san francisco on th october there were a lot of america heading back to america from scotland because of the open golf at st andrew the woman at the counter wa rude i wa actually embarrassed to be british at the time shouting snapping at people and just had a real horrible way about her on the flight from london to san francisco prior to the hour check in i spent to reserve two seat for our once in a life time holiday to america once we boarded it wa evident that the seat i wa sitting in wa broken the recliner button wa not working and had been pushed into the frame of the arm rest i asked the flight attendant at the time of there wa anything that could be done but not only wa she also rude but seemed uninterested in that fact that i wa going to have to sit for hour on a flight with a seat that wouldn t recline i eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault only to find out that multiple other seat on the economy seating area were also broken attitude with british airway staff ha been absolutely horrendous so after getting off the flight i decided to make a complaint to british airway bearing in mind that i had paid for the privilege of picking a seat i asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the hour check in only to be told no they don t do refund i paid for a product that wa broken met with nothing but rude staff and they are telling me they can t refund the cost of booking the seat email to the customer team and they are still refusing they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault wa reported prior to me sitting in that seat all they have now offered me is a ba voucher which i declined on the basis that if they picked my seat for example i hadn t payed for the seat prior to the hour check in then a voucher would be ok but not when i have spent my own money to select a seat that wa broken after all my experience with ba i will not be using them again very rude and unhelpful staff and i will chose another carrier in the future im actually ashamed that ba treat people the way they do when they are a national airline for great britain,negative

dfw lhr had an easy transfer at dfw from american airline to british airway heading to london first ride on an a left me with the feeling that this plane type won t ever be my first choice wa seated upstairs where the cabin space seemed very roomy but the seat and row were very cramped when the passenger in front reclined the back of the seat wa inch from my face and i had a real difficult time trying to view the seat back entertainment screen the seat itself wasn t too bad but i felt squished and locked in on a plus side having a window seat gave me this nice storage area by my side ground staff were pleasant and cabin crew were really nice plenty of beverage offered and multiple water run were made during the night dinner wa rubbish a wa the morning pre landing snack the entertainment system wa very responsive and had a pretty good selection of movie tv music and game all in all it wa an ok experience and did get me to london on time and our baggage arrived safely but i m not sold on the a t at lhr is another story that will be in a different review what a mess that place is,positive
check in at jersey straightforward there is a small business class lounge at jersey with reasonable drink range and some limited food flight boarded on time but take off wa delayed due to poor visibility at lhr captain kept u well informed and we eventually took off min behind schedule with a minute late arrival at heathrow good service from the cabin crew and a bacon roll and coffee served disappointing that the wait for case at heathrow t wa a long a the flight,negative
check in at lhr t wa very quick and queue for security short we used the south lounge which wa supposed to be the quieter at the time but wa very busy and difficult for our group of to get seated together flight boarded on time whilst this is only a short flight min the service of the cabin crew wa outstanding glass of champagne coronation chicken salad and a coffee all served with a smile and a little banter in spite of some of the issue with ba their cabin crew are usually exceptional and this wa no exception flight landed on time and bag delivered quite promptly,positive
the check in process wa smooth i got access to the iga lounge which wa nice but not a nice ha the turkish airline lounge on board wa what all this flight wa about this wa my first time flying intra european business class and though i wa well prepared i still found it underwhelming first the seat is just a normal economy seat with the middle seat blocked off there is no personal ife so basically no entertainment for a hour flight meal service wa very slow and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin one of the choice ran out plus the meal wa not a good a the economy meal i got on my turkish airline flight a few day ago i could see that staff did their best but since there were business class passenger on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley there wa so much they could do also the passenger shared one single wc meaning a long line for the bath room something i have rarely seen in business class arrived at lhr we did not get a contact gate but the thing wa that there wa no bus either and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus would come it finally came of course and the delay wa more on the airport than the airline but since ba is the main operator at heathrow t such thing will affect their reputation,positive
this is my first time flying ba s new club suite which in my opinion is very good flight to the u including mine departed from concourse c of terminal which did not have many shopping or dining option however it wa quiet so finding seating wa quite easy the highlight is the club suite which is spacious and provides a great deal of privacy meal service wa slow and everything wa served on one tray all at once i think now is the time for them to begin to get back to pre pandemic standard at least the food tasted good which wa not something i previously experienced on ba flight even in first class,positive

three flight london to reykjavik return and frankfurt to london generally the flight were of an acceptable standard though the seat and legroom are quite tight for a three hour flight the cabin crew were efficient and generally friendly a big plus for ba wa informative announcement from the cockpit often missing on other airline flight operated generally close to the advertised time but ba wa let down by chaotic check in and boarding procedure in preparation for each flight the number of check in staff wa one or at most two in frankfurt the lone check in agent wa also checking in business class passenger why are economy class passenger boarded from the front and not from the back this wa standard across the three flight but slowed down the boarding process immensely a people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passenger stowing their enormous cabin baggage it would make much more sense to board people at the back first and to enforce baggage rule so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passenger who boarded last the small bottle of water and a half full bag of crisp offered a a snack on a three hour flight to iceland wa just tokenism and compared badly with what air france offered on a subsequent short flight to paris at reykjavik there wa no departure lounge next to the gate passenger had to queue wherever they could in the corridor,negative

the customer service of british airway is really bad you can t reach any call centre agent even after waiting for min now i really appreciate emirate and turkish airline after facing ba s low quality customer service not only the customer service but the food they offer during a long haul ldn jnb is really low quality other airline operator which are working with do co for flight catering are way better than ba i guess ba ha selected the lowest budget option from do co overall my rating is for ba you can feel how stingy ba is when you fly with them note respect to their cabin crew,positive
ba is still charging premium airline fare however delivering nothing better than what a low cost offer seat doe not recline legroom is minimal causing anyone taller than m a torture to fly a being in a sardine can good old time of being a glamour flying ba ha far gone ground force almost reduced to only a very cheap pack of crispy and water the only positive side is the cabin crew always there for you and happy or well pretending at least for the price they charge i advise every passenger to fly any other low cost airline a an alternative you pay extra for absolutely nothing,positive
this a new route which ba introduced at the beginning of june after several year of covid related delay the business class experience wa i fear typical of the nickel dime policy introduced by the airline over the past decade plus helpful and friendly fa minus the cabin wa fairly cramped with six seat across each pod had surprisingly little room with only very limited storage space it wa hard to adjust the seat particularly getting it to lie flat even the fa found it difficult the in flight entertainment wa very limited with a poor choice of film tv programme and music the food choice and quality wa poor one of the three main wa unavailable and my pea and mushroom risotto wa almost inedible the cheese selection wa also poor i don t know what the business class offering from ba s rival flying similar route are like but the experience doe not match up to that provided by singapore airline on their flight to the far east and australasia,negative
a a regular ba customer on european flight it is sad but true to note that standard continue to slip particularly ground service at lhr and the atrocious handling of delay staff at the entrance to the first wing wa brusque to put it mildly rude to be accurate flight boarded at for a departure min later late customer were allowed to board and not a single pa or apology from the flight deck or crew the benefit of low cost airline is they they don t hang around for latecomer sadly ba is in a time warp over this ba pilot used to be some of the best for updating status but this ha dropped dramatically in the last year the food standard and choice in the t first lounge are one of the item that have been improved post covid inflight service on this short h m flight wa a light dinner tray only choice by row with passenger in club europe only salad option were available no printed menu offered and the cabin staff explained he had only been given menu for customer it appears there is no supply control in place at ba food quality wa okay but while do co supply this the do co meal on turkish airline remain superior to what ba manages i flew turkish day ago staff service wa perfunctory but no attempt to interact with any customer in club europe cabin i end where i started ba standard continue to slip,positive

the a is a wonderful aircraft quieter than any other aircraft i ve flown flight wa delayed arriving at vancouver from london which meant that departing flight from vancouver wa also delayed passenger waited almost minute at london terminal for baggage to arrive excuse given by ba ground staff wa that the baggage staff are very busy right now and our baggage will arrive soon onboard amenity and service quite disappointing seat wa reasonably spacious but did not offer sufficient back support meal size and portion considerably smaller than when i last flown with ba a tiny ham and cheese croissant for breakfast cabin crew noticeably absent from cabin during flight no offer of water juice or other beverage during the flight overall a fairly disappointing experience with ba,negative

i travelled on the th april with my baby in economy class flight ba and ba i had the pleasure of meeting sarah air stewardess she wa absolutely amazing i received great service from her along with other staff but more importantly she went above and beyond it wa hard enough travelling with an infant but her assistance throughout the flight wa really appreciated she repeatedly asked if i needed anything a i had arham in my lap most of the time she held him whilst i had a cup of tea at the front of the aircraft we had a chat and the service wa just amazing it is something i will never forget thank you for being there and for all your support throughout the flight i have worked in aviation but the job you do is remarkable and under appreciated hope you see this,positive

recent trip to boston departing lhr t ground staff were absolutely fantastic and made an extra effort to make sure we were prepared for all the covid entry requirement in the u they were really friendly and personable very short queue for bag drop and security i would say it took u minute from kerbside to lounge which is fantastic considering what is going on in the uk at the moment boarding wa very quick and efficient and wa completed within minute seated on the last row of economy i really appreciated the low density layout in economy compared to the abreast seating myself and my colleague strategically booked the aisle seat either side of the centre and were lucky enough to have no one sat between u which really helped considering most of the foot space in these older seat is taken up by the ife box it really helped and would have been significantly less comfortable had we been sat next to each other the cabin crew were excellent well trained and personable they were very visible throughout the flight and pro actively offered drink outside of meal service meal service wa very efficient with cabin crew pro actively removing tray from people who had finished early something that you very rarely see in economy the food by do co wa exceptional i don t think i ve eaten so much on a trans atlantic flight in economy it will be interesting to compare it on the return flight when it catered by an out station overall it wa a great flight helped by the additional space we had but nonetheless a good performance by ba which totally exceeded my expectation based on the review here and elsewhere i would definitely consider flying with them again,positive
my son travelled alone for the first time to pursue his study and we were very concerned about any issue he might have especially reading the review about the airline but his flight wa experience wa good with no delay and reached toronto in time we are thankful to british airway to provide a hassle free flight to my son especially after the trouble the airline have gone through due to pandemic unfortunately people with good experience do not post their review skewing the review negatively the flight wa very expensive though a we booked late after being dumped by air canada swiss air after they cancelled their flight at the last moment,positive
a a seasoned traveller and a loyal ba customer i am appalled at the company s recent drop in standard we were booked to fly from zhr lhr on a mile ticket in february when we arrived at check in several hour before our scheduled departure we were informed that we would have to pay for our baggage even though our ticket clearly included free checked baggage we were held at check in for over an hour whilst the check in agent went to consult with her manager who then confirmed that we would have to pay to check in our baggage we have no option but to pay this charge however a a result of this delay at check in arrived at the gate to find that our flight had closed a this wa the last flight of the day we were forced to find expensive overnight hotel accommodation i tried contact ba customer service after this incident on numerous occasion however they didn t bothered to respond at the rd attempt after i cc the ceo on my complaint i got a one line response saying that there wa no free baggage included with our ticket at this point i got my solicitor to write a letter and they finally agreed to refund my baggage charge however they are refusing to compensate me for the missed flight and the considerable expense and loss that i incurred a a result of their mistake,negative

check in easy at bgi due to u checking flightradar and finding the flight wa delayed by nearly hour no notification from the airline so other passenger arrived earlier easy boarding in sequence number seat is a joke for hour flight no leg room on isle seat of the seat in front frame block you stretching your leg and once the passenger in front reclines it even worse food is mediocre with poor choice and all of the drink choice had run out before the stewardess had arrived to my seat only choice coca cola water or red wine the connecting flight from lhr man wa cancelled with no contact from the airline i only found out trying to book a seat on the return leg with no alternative flight provided we had to privately book a taxi from lhr to manchester for person a this worked out cheaper than the train the outbound flight wa also a farce no mention of terminal change at lhr from to so quick turnaround changing terminal wa chaotic and stressful for older relative travelling with u overall shocking from british airway and can guarantee i will never use them again,negative
british airway travel with confidence probably the most unsuitable tag line they should be ashamed back in october i booked a holiday to punta cana with ba only to have it cancelled early in late last year i also booked heathrow to malaga for a family wedding in may guess what a few week ago that also got cancelled i had the chance to rebook with ba but with so many cancellation planned i wa not willing to take the risk of not making my destination for such an important event so applied for and received a refund i have now also asked for my executive club account to be closed a i shall no longer be wasting my time booking with such a shamble of an airline my suggestion is if you want to travel with confidence choose another airline any airline,negative

i have been battling a long overdue refund with ba regarding a flight originally booked in the flight wa cancelled a voucher wa issued another flight wa booked using this voucher and then again cancelled after trying to use the voucher for a new flight ba kept advising i couldn t a the voucher had been used i asked them to check the status of that flight a it never left and the agent advised she didn t have access to that information two year in i managed to speak to someone who recognised that either a voucher or refund wa due and made a note on my record i then decided to pursue a refund a felt this would be less problematic ba have acknowledged they owe me a refund one phone call they said it will be with me in working day i then chased when it wa long overdue i wa then told it will be with me in working day the refund never came i try regularly to get through to customer service for the automated system to advise no agent are available i have also sent two follow up message via the case reference link they sent me requesting an update but with no response honestly feel very let down by ba who up until this i felt were the more trustworthy and reliable airline i suspect they will have ruined many trusted relationship with customer by now,positive
when i tried to check in they required a certificate of insurance for covid travel but i did not have it i tried for over hour to get it issued but my bank where i had the travel insurance the department that could issue the certificate wa closed it wa after a very long time i got a cover letter which the bank sent to me but then to be told i had missed the check in by minute they would not let me board and i missed the flight so i contacted ba and tried to rebook another departure flight only to be told that because i missed my departing flight my return flight had automatically been cancelled and this wa ba policy so then they worked out a new price to book the flight but now the price wa i originally paid for the flight i then did a search on google and found flight for flying out with air mauritius and returning with ba on the same flight i wa originally supposed to return on unfortunately ba had made me miss day of my holiday i searched for over an hour but could not find anywhere on ba site that i needed the insurance document when i checked in for the mauritius airway flight they did not ask for the insurance document and i had a lovely flight with no issue every time i fly with ba i have a bad experience and i promise i will never fly with them again,negative

this flight wa not affected by recent problem with ba and i wa quite impressed by the british airway premium economy product in a new boeing overall premium economy turned out to be premium and clearly a step up from economy towards business class also the premium economy product came across much better in the boeing than in the old b or even than in the b seat wa very comfortable and had nice leg room food service and entertainment option were good clearly worth the extra money for premium economy,positive
british airway continues to decline in customer service i used to love this airline and now i have had three poor experience back to back regarding their customer service on the phone with flight change and voucher the most recent experience ha cost me more than originally booked due to bad rep advice and multiple call to the company even a part of the executive club silver i continue to be left on hold for age and in the last week have spent over hour on the phone seeking support at this rate they have lost my trust,positive

i connected into madrid on iberia and wrote a scathing review of their awful long haul business class service british airway short haul business class wa in a totally different class the cabin had row of seat in bc a record for me the staff met u at the door in a very cheerful way and this wa a sign of the highly professional way they would continue to look after u throughout the flight the messaging from cabin crew and flight crew wa excellent the food wa first class nothing wa too much for the staff why oh why can two member of the same company offer such different level of sift and hard service my thought is that it must be ingrained in the ethic of the company british airway keep up the good work it would be better if you had proper business class seat like some of your european competitor overall you made me feel proud to be a brit,positive

business lounge wa closed at pisa airport which wa probably beyond the control of british airway but a it had been closed since january the least british airway could have done would have issued their customer who paid for this service voucher to be used at the airport i complained about this to ba and a compensation they said they would credit my account with avios point which i felt wa an adequate compensation and at that point felt ba had handled the situation in a prompt and professional manner however that wa seven week ago and no avios point have been added to my account i have called their call centre multiple time at one point being put on hold for an hour to put through to the right department when the phone wa answered i wa told it wa the wrong department and to phone a number which wa read out to me which wa the same number i wa calling this scenario ha replayed itself probably about twenty time now it is clear that ba have no intention of resolving this and are just making their customer go round in circle before they give up this airline is absolutely appalling in the way it treat it customer,positive

i am constantly amazed how british airway continue to get thing wrong i pretty much though they had covered all those base and in the last year living in the uk i have watched their decline with great sadness my flight to paris wa no exception not only wa the flight late overcrowded and not managed at all by disinterested staff that we sat on the tarmac full boarded for one hour while we waited for catering to be loaded on front and then back left me gobsmacked a they barely offer any food service anyway small packet of crisp and an even smaller bottle of water on a minute flight i wondered why they thought it wa good operational planning to delay a whole plane load of passenger so that people in business class could speedily eat a poor quality meal on the flight to paris a it transpired i wa over minute late and missed the meeting i wa flying to paris to attend never again,negative
the short haul flight were the best with the crew on the final leg giving the excellent service that we all hope for we chose out flight very carefully so that we were booked on flight with the club world suit not the ying yang arrangement that they still offer at the last minute the aircraft wa changed so we had to put up with the ying yang which really should have been pensioned off age ago most business class offer across but this layout still squeeze in across a we only take one long haul leisure trip a year in business class we always lose out on the point game but i take exception to having paid in full on a non refundable basis not to be allowed to reserve my seat the point gained from this trip alone would have allowed u bronze status but we were not given this status until after the trip when it is useless to u this status would have allowed u to book the seat day prior to departure when they were still available rather than the hour when they were not available on the long haul return flight i wa unable to book a window seat but on boarding after the door had closed there wa a window seat still vacant i asked if i could move and wa told by the fa she would check nothing happened but after take off a passenger wa moved from economy to that seat judging by the interaction between them i would bet it wa someone on staff travel i think it disgraceful that a full fare paying passenger should be treated like this take off wa just after hr but we were not offered a drink service before supper but were told we could order a drink that would be delivered on out tray with the meal had we done this our meal would have been cold by the time we ate it in summary would i ever fly with ba again no not if i had half a chance of going with another airline,positive
a very comfortable new suite flight with great service and good food crew wa wonderful new seat is great except the shoulder strap is very uncomfortable entertainment great wifi wa annoying cutting off and needing constant reconnecting generally a positive experience,positive

ba is getting a real bashing on this forum and i thought i d buck the trend and report a virtually flawless experience of a short hop from edi to lcy on ba this monday easy check in decent lounge experience except the very amiable staff were still forced to serve from behind barrier very clean plane which left on time ridiculous amount of legroom in d it is a bulkhead seat but with lot more space than a or c reasonable cooked breakfast served by a very attentive and capable csm and arrived min earlier than scheduled what s not to like which is my overall experience with the vast majority of my ba experience over the last year anyway i thought it would be nice to read a positive review for once,positive
new club suite are amazing the only let down is the bed is a little too firm but the pillow wa the most comfortable pillow i have ever used food wa ok a i have had better on ba in the past and i can understand why they put everything on a single tray which is ok the cabin crew were brilliant but i wa surprised that after dinner the crew didn t once come round with beverage or even bottled water ba really have a great hard product here and i would suspect the soft product will improve once covid restriction become less of an issue well done ba,positive

the worst budget airline i ve ever used far worse than ryanair and i refuse to fly with them even though they re basically free ba charge about x a much a other budget but have the worst service spent an hour checking in because their outdated computer crashed they left u sat on the plane for over hour because they couldn t connect to the internet then left of our luggage behind because they would have had to refund everyone s flight if they waited another min for the other luggage trolley to arrive it took three day to return it and cost u s then on return i ve now been sat here nearly two hour and there s no sign of our luggage again i don t know how a company can be this incompetent but i ll be pursuing for compensation i have some free flight from amex but i won t be using them because it s not worth going through this again,negative
first the actual flight are fine and the staff on all flight zrh lhr gva lhr lhr zrh first in economy are absolutely fine chatty and friendly they are a credit to the company the infrastructure however is appalling zrh lhr impossible to check in online and just staff to check in everyone for flight resulting in mislabelled luggage and an hour delay to sort this out gva lhr hr late a no one at lhr to tow the aircraft to the gate lhr zrh min late due to slow gate staff even when you check in online you have to queue at the airport to get the actual boarding pas there are more example and for this reason until they sort out their stressed ground staff it is impossible to recommend this airline onboard getting to be onboard,positive

flew to barbados march on ba in the new club class suite a huge improvement on the old yin and yang club class which we unfortunately endured on the way back comfortable big tv screen with high quality picture and good headphone plenty of nook and cranny for storing small item and very private nice friendly fa s called by my name from the off and pretty good drink service with a good dinner served once again let down by a poor at best choice of movie on the in flight entertainment system thank goodness the latest james bond movie wa showing took off and landed on time smooth flight only one letdown the usual extortionate fee charged for pre booking a seat come on ba stop nickel and diming it spoil what could be a really good business class product and after all we already pay quite a bit for the privilege i recommend with the usual caveat,positive
very poor flight from cape town to london after the chaos of cape town airport passenger handling with incredibly long queue to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hour in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choice for a break before boarding the flight boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne the captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the am lifting of the overnight jet ban at heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so this wa no big deal then the captain announced that due to it issue at heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite period with the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for business class but this wa not forthcoming in the event take off wa permitted quite soon after the crew had distributed menu but then did a pa to say that there were change to each of the main course a drink order wa taken for pre dinner drink for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner drink and nut were served circa minute after take off in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler the food looked bland unappetising and tasted the more so the cheese two small piece were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney no top up of the wine wa offered we did ask for a second glass and it wa provided on a very individualised basis and coffee wa not served since we had hit some mild turbulence the flight wa some hour in duration and no other snack or beverage were offered prior to breakfast which wa provided separately to each passenger a they showed sign of being awake breakfast wa slightly more edible than dinner coffee or tea were offered by individual mug orange juice wa available on request cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal service but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to request for individual item come on british airway you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectation and compete with other airline on similar route for the cost of a business class ticket passenger are enjoying only additional space and seat comfort flatbed a a benefit over an economy ticket at or below of the price paid for the premium cabin time wa when flying in business class wa real treat no longer is this the case,positive
our main complaint is that the limited food served wa bland barely edible and by far the worst we ve ever experienced compared to other airline used in the past the staff were friendly enough but they were rarely seen between meal no snack were offered during the flight this is so different to every other airline we have used in the past after hour of flying the breakfast offered wa a tiny cold stale ham and cheese roll and a small plain yoghurt with a couple of oreo if ever you decide to fly with them i suggest that you bring your own food we certainly will on our return flight but will never use british airway again,negative
complete and utter chaos at heathrow yet again surely the ceo sean doyle must now take responsibility and step aside for the consistent and continuous it problem that cause flight to be cancelled and delayed the queue for the first wing check in at am today wa over hour and subsequent flight to malaga hr late leaving the gate updated about the delay time but strangely not one person apologised or said sorry ba seems to think this is normal practice nowadays a emerald oneworld i wish there wa an alternative because ba ha become intolerable and this is after flying them for year since bea boac day,negative

british airway are in the process of upgrading all it fleet to the new club suite but ba had the yr old packed like sardine club world product the lounge at cpt wa also bursting at the seam and food order were so behind that many passenger had left by the time their food arrived on boarding we were surprised to find that the menu amenity kit and bottle of water had already been placed in the storage drawer we suspect this is another cynical time saving initiative on the part of ba frustratingly the menu turned out to be incorrect and the replacement dish were probably the worst we have ever encountered in any business class on any airline the drink run wa cancelled without any warning on the spurious basis of a passenger with a nut allergy it s hard to avoid suspicion that cabin crew were being economical with the truth apart from a rather turbulent ride the flight wa otherwise uneventful and arrival wa slightly ahead of schedule baggage handling wa however atrociously slow,negative
we flew to funchal madeira yesterday madeira ha no covid restriction for entry yet ba asked u to upload our nh vaccination pass before we could check in online i received an ok about an hour later but my husband did not so i couldn t check in online we arrive at heathrow hour before departure and stood in a long queue for check in there were just desk open for a queue of approx traveller then several people went on break or disappeared so we were down to one desk open with the queue barely moving i went to complain to various ba staff who said the manager had been told and more people were coming one blonde lady walked around for age shepherding traveller into the queue before sitting down at a desk another man later did likewise making u wonder why they hadn t simply worked at the desk from the beginning all in all we stood in that queue for a good hour before almost running to the security queue which thankfully moved quickly then we hurriedly bought a sandwich walked to our departure gate and stood on the bus to the plane the whole experience wa extremely stressful and took the best part of hour we did not have time to sit down until we did so on the plane and completely unnecessary if we had been able to check in online this would not have happened my husband s vaccination pas is fine but not required for madeira i think it is a system failure a he received an email yesterday morning saying his pas wa not in order a did i even though i d previously been told i could check in online also unnecessary a if ba had staffed the desk properly the queue would have moved a staff member told u ba had laid off lot of staff during lock down and wa now begging them to return but having been treated badly they didn t want to the flight itself wa fine on time we were given a bag of crisp and a bottle of water again fine nothing praise worthy,negative

i really can t believe they have the audacity to call this first class the check in staff at singapore were abrupt and unhelpful the official ba lounge in singapore wa closed so they re using a cheap generic alternative which anyone can pay twenty pound to go in suffice to say it wa not pleasant onboard wa like being in the middle of a bad comedy sketch i can not believe the two stewardess have ever had any first class training i had to ask for slipper the first drink took nearly an hour to arrive despite only having passenger to serve between the two of them the poor woman sat next to me ordered a wine which came filled to the brim i mean it s first class not a student house party neither had any knowledge of the wine on the menu most of the food wa awful my steak wa dry over cooked and tough and whichever catering manger signed off on a canap of soggy mushroom on top of a chunk of polenta should be sacked immediately i will say the cheese and port were nice however the worst thing wa the constant galley noise there wa a cart stowage immediately in front of my seat k which they were in and out of all night and appeared incapable of shutting without slamming they also seemed to have stored their personal belonging in to the bin immediately above my seat so we re in and out of that a well i will say the seat itself is very well designed but personally i m happy in club and would never do first again,positive

our flight back to athens on a different airline wa very delayed causing u to miss our first flight home i understand that they were not required to help due to the delayed flight being a different airline what s worse is that they went ahead and canceled our ticket for our connecting flight which we would have been able to make based on another flight out we found causing u to have to buy much more expensive ticket home that resulted in u having an overnight layover and having to buy a hotel room on top of ridiculously expensive last minute ticket the absolute worst customer service i have ever dealt with and i will never be flying with them again,negative
flight took off two hour late after what can only be described a a shamble at the airport no airbridge to the aircraft which is not acceptable the aircraft wa better than the outbound flight who screen wa so small after serving only about rd of the cabin no first choice only a vegetarian dish or a chicken dish from the economy cabin the airline must know that vegetarian will order a meal so why include it a a choice also to offer a roll of ham cheese for breakfast after a hour flight is cost saving a hot breakfast should be offered with only minute between my connecting flight due to late arrival i made staff aware whilst they let me and others passenger of the flight first there wa no staff to assist in getting u to our flight it wa a struggle to get my connecting flight on arriving in glasgow got txt to say my bag did not make the flight first time using ba premium and likely my last,negative

the economy cabin wa surprisingly underpopulated on this flight with only about passenger but business class wa three quarter full boarding wa therefore mercifully quick and take off on schedule sadly ba make use of the old club world product which now seems like a step back in time after experiencing the new club suite on ba there are some good point about the old club world the drawer capable of taking a laptop and the more comfortable seat when flat but other than those it s an embarrassment the tiny poorly responsive screen is almost beyond belief service wa perfunctory and the meal service conformed to the current overly cautious post covid requirement with everything served at the same time this doe mean that the meal is over and done with relatively speedily but it s a lacklustre experience in contrast to ba s competitor and smack of continued cost cutting queue for the three toilet in business class were unacceptable at time and there wa limited attention paid to keeping them clean arrival wa on schedule but covid paperwork processing meant that it wa an hour before we were able to collect our baggage,positive
british airway continues to go downhill we flew business class and the experience wa like economy from year ago except you can have a glass of champagne we were packed in full x seat because of it issue the day before even if weren t the seat pitch and width is the same a economy gone are the little pretend table in the middle seat to give some illusion of style the food wa dreadful the in flight service wa unsophisticated ba used to have an acceptable european business class they don t any more other european airline offer much better in flight experience in business class in comparison ba is taking premium and frequent flyer for granted and treating u like mug how i miss the politeness of old ba business class from around year ago how i used to look forward to it the small gesture like hanging up a coat giving you a hot towel having nice food being served from the galley rather than from the manky trolley covid is not the reason this is year of cost cutting and the result is dreadful,positive

another episode of unmitigated shamble when it come to customer service the day after storm eunice and english half term holiday are getting underway so you make allowance and you accept there could be some delay the fact they were then compounded by the late cancellation of a raft of flight to domestic and european destination on the evening of saturday february for operational reason wa pitiful you could not rebook via ba s website instead passenger were compelled to queue at gate a at lhr to possibly rebook and be provided with accommodation overnight some ba cabin crew were helpful but those in customer service in the south lounge who simply directed passenger to the ever growing queue at a were a disgrace,negative

this past november december i flew washington london return and on the strength of that trip my first in two year the inflight service quality appears to have pretty much returned to the pre pandemic status quo ante the cabin wa clean and well maintained seat were comfortable food and drink were good including a very tasty hertfordshire roast pork on the return leg and the ba cabin crew remain the best in the business this wa one of a number of booking that i had to re book a number of time due to flight cancellation and contrary to the experience of many here my re booking were handled courteously and thoroughly although i did have a number of lengthy wait on hold but under the present circumstance that s to be expected it s good to see that the everyday product ha held up so well amid this dreadful time and i m looking forward to future trip on ba,positive
i had the best experience i have ever had with an airline our initial flight to dubai wa canceled by royal air maroc and we had to find a new flight at the last minute i found that booking with them wa extremely simple unfortunately we had to cancel our flight the day of the departure i called the customer service waited about minute before i could speak with someone and within minute the flight wa canceled and they offered me a full refund the person on the line wa extremely nice understanding and willing to help u i had never dealt with such a nice employee from any airline i got the full refund on my credit card the day after i usually chose the cheapest flight ticket regardless of the airline but from now on i ll definitely make sure to check with british airway first,positive

boarding wa slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack air con at the gate the club suite cabin were about full but the rest of the plane can t have been much more than occupancy whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabin despite that the drink and food service in business wa efficient and the current policy of serving all course at once meant that dinner wa done and dusted two hour after take off which is a real bonus on a night time flight however the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish wa almost inedible the club suite is a big improvement on the ancient cw product although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartment that invite losing a smartphone or two one definitely miss the drawer at foot level in old cw the large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole ife system wa much more responsive the new seat don t significantly aid sleeping particularly a there s an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine waking up two hour before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queue for the toilet performance of the flight deck wa up to it usual high standard and arrival wa twenty minute ahead of schedule progress through border control wa speedy but baggage collection wa delayed for unspecified reason overall a good flight,positive
unfortunately having just flown in the new club world cabin this time we had an incredibly old plane the good wa the cabin crew who tried to make the trip a pleasant a possible the bad wa the in flight entertainment the screen were unwatchable when they worked my wife s didn t and post ipad era just don t live up the food wa just about okay without being anything special but all served at once apparently the crew explained this is because of a shortage of staff i m afraid ba ha a lot to do to regain it standing in the aviation world the competition is too fierce now to sit on your laurel,positive
utterly appalling company we ve flown with them two time now and both time it s been a disaster the first time return flight wa delayed by over hour there wa nobody at the gate to tell u this so a large group of passenger had to roam round dubai airport looking for ba staff there were none eventually another airline told u to go down some unmarked stair where a very angry person told u it wa our fault and we should have been given a letter we had no letter they then put u on a bus to the other terminal when we arrived there wa nobody to greet u we were literally just left there we had to yet again contact another airline who managed to find u transport to the hotel when we got there we were told it wa full and we couldn t choose our room we were given a terrible dirty cramped room several time throughout the night we were called to tell u our flight had been moved eventually we got to board the next day my tray table wa broken a wa the window blind and i didn t get a meal no compensation wa offered the second time i need to reschedule my flight the website assured me this wa fine but provided no link i needed to phone up if you need to phone ba don t even bother trying i never got to speak to anyone and just ended up booking a hotel to wait for my flight rather than rescheduling the food ha been terrible meagre portion given infrequently my sandwich wa inedible,negative
over the past year i have flown with british airway twice and ended up in the exact same predicament of having to wait around all day in london heathrow for a hour flight home to newcastle while the holiday and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at heathrow are useless first time in february i got stuck in heathrow due to storm ciara when travelling home from work which wa not the airline fault however the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport wa a joke they had to staff ran a kiosk queue of over unhappy traveller whilst they could have set up mini kiosk on the unused gate to get through everyone quicker their wa no crowd control and at one point after queuing for hour plus the staff decided to shut up shop in the end after a hour battle i wa lucky enough to get home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when i finally spoke to someone in november i decided to give ba a second chance and booked to go to new york since the plane landed late into lhr i missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while a i rushed through custom i did manage to make it to the gate with minute to spare and the plane still in the terminal but since they had taken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a later flight my layover wa now hour and all i got from the guest service wa a food voucher to spend and a phone number for what i thought wa complaint but after being on hold for minute found out it wa not from complaint considering the fact this could have all been avoidable with more assistance to have only been given a food voucher for seemed really cheap a few day after i got home i then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed i wa and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaint staff were not working when i got a response i said i wanted back off my holiday i got an apology and told the staff at heathrow will be better but in term of good will and compensation i wa offered nothing,negative
return trip cape town to durban in club class highlighted the inconsistency our outbound trip in december wa good in all respect whereas the return trip wa disappointing check in wa fine apart from the agent failing to label one of bag priority resulting in a long wait for our third bag the lounge wa busy but no complaint we went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen where there wa no sign of activity although the screen wa still showing the same gate and departure time shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight wa delayed from to and the gate wa changed to the lower level bus gate the informational screen had now updated to the delayed time and new gate i checked on the flight radar app which showed that our aircraft had started in durban and flown to cape town port elizabeth back to cape town and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight in fact looking at it schedule and turn around time it wa always going to be late boarding eventually started at with departure at minute late drink service only started minute later followed by lunch the food wa good but the wine offering very mediocre and not up to club standard with the price of good wine in south africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine lunch service wa quick but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there wa no offering of top up drink unless specifically requested overall this wa a disappointing flight with a lacklustre crew,negative
i used british airway for the first time and i have to admit that i am impressed with their service firstly i want to thank the lady that assisted me to weigh my luggage my flight wa however due to unforeseen circumstance i arrived at the airport around i wa convinced that i wa going to miss my flight because the queue wa very long i stood there a few minute but then realized that i would miss my flight i went to club check in and the lady wa incredibly kind to me i just cannot believe how patience she wa with me even though i wa at fault she weighed my luggage and i wa able to board the flight successfully i wa not aware that this airline give out free meal we got a sandwich and drink and we had an option to choose between vegetarian and chicken i personally love free stuff so i will be ditching flysafair even though they have excellent service a well in the near future unfortunately diversity the first time i flew wa in and i have to admit that i have never seen such diversity amongst cabin crew staff however with british airway it wa different the staff wa very kind and friendly a well what a wonderful experience to fly with these guy,positive
i recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on british airway from detroit to bangalore and back given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layover i decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket i wa quickly dissuaded of any misconception that i wa special because i spent that extra money or wa in business class from shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff i experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journey the trump wa being stranded in london having missed my connection and spending close to hour to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight being a business class traveller had no bearing a we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn some special passenger were escorted to the club world check in when we asked the lady she told u to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get u when the counter freed up needless to say it never did finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that wa running around in a frenzy and wa rebooked so i come back to the question can big corporation lie with no accountability why would i spend my hard earned money on something that gave me nothing extra shame on you british airway for your complete disregard for your passenger stop your lying or update your promise,negative
i have flown with ba for many year and today wa another poor experience a i ve witnessed the airline decline into a sub par service i understand that it s been a tough two year for airline but ba s decline started before the pandemic and it ha now truly plummeted enormous queue at jfk ba check in terminal even the priority lane wa at a standstill for at least half an hour before people started complaining they d miss their flight terrible efficiency at the check in counter at time only one member of staff is processing people whilst other ba staff stood around on their phone or having a chat one member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in the interior of the plane wa generally filthy crumb bit of food stain mark all around the seating area they give you a single wet wipe which i used to think wa for your hand but now i see most passenger wiping down their surrounding area there are some very good and courteous member of staff but there are also some awful member of staff who behave unprofessionally on this particular flight one of the cabin crew is a swearing about his colleague at the back of the plane who apparently wasn t pulling his weight very poor i used to be a proud ba flyer but now i just feel like i m clinging on to my airline status which doesn t actually provide you a better service these day,positive
the entertainment selection wa sub par minimal selection and the new release were not new release my food left something to be desired two of the seat in our row the earphone jack didn t work the plane wa either uncomfortably hot or too cold find a medium temp just overall a very basic generic airline,positive
straightforward and friendly baggage drop on to south lounge no polite conversation on have you used our lounge before no indication that it wa so busy there wa nowhere to sit at all considering even the m distancing had to roam the entire lounge lugging our bag on the carpeted floor with no success at all gave up after minute and decided to try another lounge arrived and everything wa actually right in front of u and actually found somewhere to sit after minute of looking around menu wa basic with no egg hash brown or any breakfast cake or muffin ordered a frittata a wa so hungry made my way to the self serve coffee counter which had basic coffee and wa straight away put off by fly hovering over the croissant and fruit flight wa departing from a gate where you had to take a train to and a if to rub salt in the wound were then told that dxb flight usually leaf from there and should ve gone to the lounge near there looking at the individual cubicle which wa to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart however the door cannot close till take off i asked for the artisan crisp or biscuit on the menu and it took them over an hour lunch came in another almost hour asked if could swap pudding a am not a crumble person said will surely try but clearly didn t with no apology or even trying portion were small plus saw quite a few fellow passenger sleeping through lunch so asked if could have more but all wa finished chocolate are lindor nothing special about the other amenity toilet were no different to what you d expect amenity kit wa basic duvet seemed well used it wa not worth almost time the amount of a regular ticket naive to trust claim of world class standard,positive
on arrival at the warsaw airport the check in zone wa the only one that wa not announced on the flight board we had to guess and ask random people where to go once we finally found the check in desk luggage drop and check in wa appalling it took u over hour to get our bag checked and we were half way through the queue the whole process wa disorganised and very slow really the last thing you want when looking after small impatient kid lady in warsaw airport who wa supposed to direct passenger to the correct queue wa useless one check in desk for euro traveller club europe one for bag drop and one for the check in flight left delayed but the pilot managed to catch up and landed with a small delay crew on the plane wa nice and attentive luckily the in air experience wa much better but sort out your ground service at warsaw airport,positive
in glasgow one check in desk open huge queue with no business check in it took me close to an hour to bagdrop getting onto the aircraft in glasgow no hello from the crew and the same getting off i normally find ba cabin crew very nice breakfast wa a very tired looking croissant i used the ba lounge in terminal not very keen on the new table service poor choice and miniscule portion lounge staff were very nice in both direction on arrival at lhr there wa a coach transfer from t to t we were packed in like sardine so much for social distancing the flight from lhr to pisa wa delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another hr min captain advised u that there wa no tow truck for push back and when it did eventually arrive there were no baggage handler to load the container no drink or anything offered while we waited food wa not even worth mentioning a far a club europe go it s not worth the extra cost no priority baggage a mine were last onto the belt in pisa seat are economy seat with the centre one blocked off the first officer summed it up when we arrived in pisa sorry folk this trip wa a pretty poor show by ba and he wa right for the return trip on hogmanay we left on time i ve never been on a flight to or from pisa which ha left in time pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable on board i gave the food a miss heathrow back to glasgow flight left on time food wa an antipasto of some sort which i declined both case were last off again club europe is really not worth the money a you are in an economy cabin i would have thought that ba would do more about their food and onboard service since the cabin is what it is,negative
after two year of being unable to fly to our second home in south africa because of covid it wa fantastic to be back on board a ba flight to cpt and in the club suite seat k and k to boot these seat are a huge improvement on the old yin yang cw seat in term of privacy ease of access and the ife screen but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seat were just a uncomfortable when lying flat storage wa a mixed blessing too with three rather fussy little compartment rather than the decent sized drawer in the old cw meaning that a laptop would have to be stored above the food onboard wa woeful although serving all three course at the same time doe at least mean that the dinner service isn t dragged out cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm and there were the usual queue for the toilet the flight itself wa uneventful and landing wa more or less on time cpt had an efficient arrangement for checking form immediately after leaving the airbridge and there were no queue at immigration it wa good to be back,positive
i paid for a round trip flight to london and back in premium economy they bumped me from the seat for the flight back and told me i d be issued a refund instead of being issued a refund i had to contact them through several different method phone website twitter and finally email they told me i d be getting back which is less than half of the i paid for the upgrade instead they refunded i emailed again and they told me i d be getting more back when i emailed again saying that that doesn t add up to the original amount i wa told i wa getting they simply replied with that s the final amount turn out that meant they were taking back the initial refund of and i wa only getting total so i emailed them again asking why they changed the amount and they ve yet to respond so i called this morning and after explaining politely what i wa calling for they hung up on me,positive
very nice return flight with ba to add to my previous review i really like how ba organises boarding and disembarking process in group this is super comfortable a passenger don t jump out and then sweat in a queue when the gate is not even there the a wa new and the cabin had a fresh feeling with nice mood lighting row ha an enhanced legroom and thus make the hour hop very comfortable once again amazing staff and they were even more attentive and accommodating to gold level passenger always coming and asking if any help is needed lovely humus beetroot and quinoa salad for food great wifi at really competitive pricing i think it is great that they also have food alcohol offered to buy online for all travel class domestic t arrival is a breeze,positive
overall a very lovely flight with ba to edinburgh during christmas holiday lounge wa ok quite worn out although staff and food were nice much better than when i travelled last time although the plane seemed old the cabin felt very fresh clean temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking around c and had a funky lighting although seat are the same a those in economy they are pretty comfortable for a hour hop much better than those at air france and together with an enhanced legroom in row it wa wonderful for gold card passenger ba automatically reserve row in club europe with enhanced legroom which i think is a great touch the crew especially the purser were phenomenal extremely friendly adaptive to your need and professional leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste afternoon tea catering wa lovely for this short flight sandwich and scone were tasty i am actually a fan of well presented however simpler meal on board to my opinion they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust for a quick hop ba ticked all the mark here in comparison on a cdg lhr leg air france presented a chic cold starter however to me it looked a bit too complicated and except from the duck terrine rather unappetising klm served a super nice and simple chicken caesar but it wa in a paper box one big drawback wa the first wing experience at t the queue there wa so long that i decided to go through the regular line instead it s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyer their company spend to earn a gold status nevertheless the flight and most importantly the crew completely negated that drawback the flight wa one way return incl transfer to kirkwall which wa pretty expensive however the service seemed like it wa worth the money,positive
first of this wa one of the smoothest uk to u flight i have taken the boarding wa appalling and had family with kid queue for no reason at all they called family to the front but then decided to board business and premier class first which i appreciate why but why call family the worse seat ever and the legroom wa appalling the entertainment system is basic it doe not support bluetooth headphone the usb doe not support your own device for movie although the website say yes and the headphone input wa a good a useless the crew were nice so sorry i missed that,negative
flying during covid is always a challenge ba s verifly app worked perfectly and on line check in wa seamless the bag drop at t wa seamless and boarding wa done efficiently by zone although an older it had been refurbished and everything wa new and clean the cabin crew were a credit to the airline smartly dressed friendly and keen to please we were offered two drink before lunch wa served with more drink with the meal the food wa acceptable and we were given a tasty sandwich before landing obviously it wa only economy but after hour flying i arrived relaxed and unstressed,positive
flew to nashville via chicago in first excellent check in and security lounge wa good food and drink choice very good first cabin on is seat comfortable seat entertainment a little clunky cabin service top banana food and drink choice and taste amazing for an aircraft a special call out to stewart tim a credit to ba,positive
i had low expectation of business class ba on european route but this flight wa even worse t is a mess with minute queue to check bag with ton of people arriving late check in guy seemed clueless about turkey need for pcr etc ba lounge is a joke so i went out and got sushi from a restaurant there wa mulled wine in crowded lounge but just bad all round boarding wa chaos and we left an hour late a wa jammed full but business class there is little legroom and just the middle seat free you might a well fly a low cost carrier for same seat there is no inflight screen no overhead screen although the curtain wa closed economy people used the forward bathroom with no crew sending them back the only salvation wa a pretty decent shepherd pie and red wine otherwise i would avoid flying ba the next day i flew the same aircraft type to bahrain on another carrier with proper business class seat in flight screen headphone good food and drink arabic coffee date and gracious service ba hang your head in shame,negative
we ve just used the new club world for the first time and were delighted with the new configuration the privacy afforded is so much better in flight entertainment and storage were brilliant unfortunately we had the most lethargic crew ever who once the meal wa served basically disappeared the wine were warm they even forgot to offer my wife a drink with lunch and she also had a pair of used sock in her storage cabinet heathrow wa a nightmare a often happens being minute early wa rewarded with a minute wait for a gate then a hour wait for our luggage absolutely shocking in covid time,positive
my flight yesterday wa due to take off at soon after reaching the gate first passenger were called for pre boarding then gate staff said the aircraft ha not been given permission to land at aberdeen due to poor weather airport information kept telling passenger to go to gate for a further hour and a half before passenger learned the flight had been cancelled via the ba app we then had to join a line for the customer service desk it took two hour to reach the desk in my case on reaching the desk i wa told i had automatically been booked on the following morning flight and being offered overnight hotel that did not meet my need so i requested cancellation and to get my bag back i wa told to cancel my booking on the ba app they could not do it at the desk i wa then directed via a gate to collect my bag this meant having to go via the uk border to reach a baggage belt then i waited for my bag for hour because they had automatically stored my bag for the following day flight ba staff were rude and dismissive of customer complaint at length of time bag were taking to arrive like it wa our fault for cancelling the alternative flight they had offered the next day,negative
it is first time we have flown ba business class in a aircraft and hopefully it will be the last firstly the check in and crew were great friendly and helpful it wa manual check in not a machine which is always much nicer no complaint at all in that department food on the journey wa adequate but no choice of starter or desert and choice for main course business class seating is with alternate seat facing backwards a are both the centre seat we were in those so you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat or you put the screen up and you are in a claustrophobic bubble you cannot see out you cannot see other passenger it wa slightly better a it wa my wife and myself but it would be utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger nowhere to put a glass bottle of water book or glass within easy reach unless you keep the table down in most business class seat you can tuck your bag under the seat in front for take off and landing but there is nowhere to put a bag so everything ha to go in the overhead locker and they are missing over the first row of centre seat so not much storage space we were in row and to get out you have to climb over the leg and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row now if you are travelling solo in the centre seat that is always the case but normally if a a couple you take aisle and centre at least you are climbing over your partner s leg not some stranger i am ft and could just about manage my wife at ft could not get over without disturbing the passenger in the row behind the reading light wa hopeless and did not shine on your book and the light controlled from the handset did not work at all this is utterly awful design and will certainly make u avoid ba in future if at all possible,positive
i claimed my mile right after my trip at the beginning of august they took almost month to reply and to my surprise to reject my request without providing any reason i have sent them a complaint per e mail and i still didn t get a reply it ha been month and i am still waiting for an answer furthermore many people were not wearing mask and when i asked the flight attendant why they were allowing people not to wear the mask they said there are medical exception when we ordered more drink they replied that we needed to pick them out ourselves what a business class customer service,negative
british airway is taking reservation and then cancelling flight without giving any reason we had further plan that all needed to be cancelled because of the flight ba did nothing to ease the process and offered absolutely no explanation of why the flight wa cancelled i am not going to travel on ba again and may not travel again this year at all,negative
i have a flight booked for january they send me an email at the beginning of december informing me that my flight wa changed my second flight wa moved to the next day making my layover hour called them wa told to just cancel what kind of answer is that i mean i still need to fly to where i am going and booking with another airline closer to the day i am flying will be more expensive it is a very big inconvenience for me and i don t even get an apology just cancel,negative
i had a future travel voucher for singapore to london which i thought would be perfect for my flight to relocate home i d been under the impression that it wa a simple process just call up and book onto the same route that i d previously paid for and that had previously been cancelled by ba themselves but on a new date how wrong i wa first i had to pay to top up my flight a significant amount equivalent to around the value of my original flight which wa a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles this wa because of price increase and the fact that i wa flying at peak time the extra charge also meant that i overall paid more than face value their online price at the time for the ticket for the flight a well a them still keeping the airline i d redeemed they explained that the online price and redemption price differ and that s just how the system work however if i had taken a refund i would have lost a lot of money to administration fee they had me in a desperate situation where i wa losing hundred of pound to them no matter what i did so i cut my loss and booked the flight or at least i thought i did the call centre agent who had previously explained she wa working remotely with no manager or supervision and no way to escalate issue took my card detail including full card number date and cvc code and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow a week later i still had no ticket no detail no charge to my card no booking reference nothing i called up to confirm the call centre agent i reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the booking team and again took my card detail once again i waited another week and sign of being booked onto a flight thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate call to british airway a they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight spanning over week on the friday before my monday flight i sat in tear to another ba call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra bag the next day around hour before i wa due to fly i finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra bag luckily i noticed this on my check in detail and managed to add a bag online the whole experience wa stressful costly and resulted in me spending hour and day on the phone listening to british airway hold music furthermore there ha been a significant cutback to ba inflight catering service due to covid resulting in smaller portion leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight though i ve flown ba repeatedly with few problem in the past their service ha gone significantly downhill,negative
extremely disappointed in trip experience i am gold mvp miler with alaska airline my ticket and travel wasnt linked with alaska airline when speaking with alaska representative they confirmed it wa due to lack of effort on british airway in accomplishing this task i could over look the lack of effort on this even though frustrating the main issue is the ticketing and flt connection process i departed egypt this morning with connecting ticket in hand once i arrived in usa apparently my alaska a flt wa changed to a hour later flight with a completely different airline delta who doe that without notifying the customer i found this out when trying to go through security in seattle they said my ticket wa not valid i had to go to alaska airline to find out what the issue wa they explained british airway had rebooked with delta this took about min with customer service then i had to go to delta to sort the mess out i am so frustrated,negative
british airway seems happy to encourage the spread of covid took the am flight from t at heathrow to paris cdg on nd november which wa boarded by bus from a remote gate the bus driver insisted on packing the bus to it maximum possible load standing by the door and telling customer to squeeze right up and he wa not leaving the terminal until the bus wa full the result wa that passenger in the bus were packed tight and the maximum facial distancing wa about cm a second coach to the aircraft followed just a few minute later and had about customer on it it is shameful that ba ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process and whilst the flight wa okay this serf to underline how ba seem happy to disregard any covid safety protocol in the airport environment in contrast on recent air france and iberia flight their ground staff are much more disciplined and actually try to control customer maybe this underline the very laissez faire attitude to covid that now prevails in the uk,positive

arrived at the south airport in tenerife hour before departure iberia had not opened the check in even with a full flight waiting the usual check in process post covid took place with the usual error in the paperwork slowing thing down passing security wa fine and iberia had a lounge with person capacity to serve drink and a simple selection of cold food boarding wa done by a meter long bus ride a the plane wa parked at the gate not sure why the plane wa a very new a neo with row of club seating the seat wa ok for a hour flight but anything longer and i would expect club europe to have more leg room than the couple of inch s between my knee and the seat in front food and drink where very good served with steel cutlery and glass tumbler good selection of wine to go with a above average salad overall it wa an ok experience with a great cabin crew,positive
check in very slow no app check in and could not check my vaccine qr code online check in staff friendly but too few of them ba silver card holder and no stockholm lounge to use boarding fine but plane wa worn out seat close together and row even worse crew really professional and happy it seemed arrival at heathrow a total shamble ba landed at no gate so waited and waited for minute then ba jetty didn t work then ba had no step very slow to leave plane a only moderately mobile wheelchair passenger struggle down the step everyone wa very patient and supportive but it wa terrible to watch so ba skimping on lounge plane condition and gate crew good seat very uncomfortable,negative

flew club europe london tenerife south november and returned november club europe seat are not comfortable you pay a lot more for exactly the same leg room but have the middle seat of empty to spread out a tiny bit for the fare i would hope for at least a couple more inch of leg room it would make a huge difference we did at least get a meal outbound cottage pie and inbound sausage and mash which were not too bad and a drink service however on the inbound ba had no white wine apparently there is a problem with their supplier did not pre book seat due to the extortionate fee for pre booking just about any other airline will not charge for pre booking a seat if you are in premium class back to the flight both in a new or nearly near a both very smooth with no timing issue at all so all good in that respect not a good check in experience at tenerife south just tacked onto the end of a large tui check in queue also not a great lounge the vip lounge is merely adequate with ok seating for an hour or two i would only just about recommend there are still reservation about exactly what ba is trying to become,positive

upon checking in at the club desk in lisbon airport our passenger locator form were found to have an incorrect reference number for our day test and the check in agent denied u boarding causing my wife who had recently spent some long time in hospital in the u k much distress he wa only doing his job of course but we requested him to call a supervisor the check in manager goncalo ribeiro came to our rescue not only did he identify the problem but spent half an hour of his time arranging a new supplier for our day test uploading it onto our plf s verifying our flight documentation and fast tracking u through check in he wa at the gate on boarding to wish u a comfortable journey we could not have asked for better service he wa a very professional ambassador for ba,positive
club europe on british airway outstanding and wonderful to have ba back the welcome on board wa warm and sincere flight attendant helpful friendly and professional great update from the flight deck super lunch and good choice of wine ba at it best hopefully this excellence is also a reflection of a new ceo with the departure of alex cruz,positive
good flight but boarding wa chaos wa gifted with the beautiful a gate at lhr t so we were bussed to the plane first time i ve used a bus gate there the a wa at t at a gate with a jetway nevertheless passenger full flight boarded via step this caused an hour waiting at the gate a well a the baggage taking age also the seat recline on g gatl f is broken,negative
usual ba economy trip pleasant crew complimentary snack and water and small bar service which ha reasonable price i am not a fan of the new neo aircraft very cramped seating and uncomfortable the armrest between seat are tiny thin and short in length and offer little support for two people and not enough for one aisle width seems smaller and going to the toilet at the back seems awkward i have done a transatlantic on this aircraft with another airline and it s not for me other than that ba still offer a good product that can be good value or over priced this time it wa good value,positive
check in wa easy security quick lounge fine lounge service returning to pre pandemic day and some self service allowed which wa great flight wa fine my wife and son felt breakfast wa more like old style economy food and perhaps i agree there wa nothing bad about food but nothing great either drink were fine and proactively served on arrival efficient pcr testing where it wa needed and fast turnaround baggage off quick,positive
what ha happened to british airway the whole pre flight experience now is prehistoric they appear to have gone back to the s and now make passenger physically queue to manually check in adding hour to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people together in a big slow queue on the premise it s due to covid precaution they are the only airline making passenger do this and they can t even open all the desk so for passenger they had two check in staff like the post office in apart from the aircraft and cabin crew literally everything else about this airline ha disintegrated to the point where they re just not reliable enough to use for business purpose and their attitude towards exec club member and other loyal customer is a disgrace i ve chosen and insisted upon ba for business and personal travel for decade and accumulated a lot of air mile i also have not one but two ba amex companion voucher that cost me k of spending to earn so that tell you how much i ve supported this airline despite their shocking decline in recent year in the last year i ve booked ba flight personal and business flight for me and two colleague but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itinerary of the have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plan and pay double for last minute alternative with other airline the personal one to st lucia they cancelled my return day after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for week that cost me my holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation a couple of week ago i noticed that one of my amex companion voucher wa apparently going to expire on nov th this year so i tried to speak to them a the world ha largely been closed since march i assumed it would be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destination properly open not to mention my experience dealing with routinely cancelled flight and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday but after day going around in circle speaking really bad english to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country i finally got through to someone at ba who told me that no they won t extend the voucher i m even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect i will not spend another penny with this airline i m not even going to bother using my second voucher and i ve cancelled my ba amex i work in the music business managing tour for band so i reckon i book flight a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude ha cost them that roll on the inevitable ba administration but at least somebody else can buy it for cheap and start rebuilding what wa once the world favourite airline but now the most ridiculed who d have thought ba could ever make ryanair look like an attractive option,positive
i have just returned from an amazing holiday and felt compelled to write a review the flight is generally a torment for me being a nervous flyer however on this occasion it wa an absolute delight on both inward and outward journey i wa impressed by the professionalism friendliness and kindness of the cabin crew i wa in economy but wa treated with the respect and service i would expect in the first class cabin my particular thanks must go to amir who wa absolute joy and a credit to british airway i cannot wait to fly again with you and that from me is huge thank you so so much,positive
the plane wa clean and air quality very good timing wa perfect i wa seated in k to begin with i had difficulty using the button to get the leg rest up a well a push back the seat when i requested a cup of tea just a the drink service started i wa told that tea would be served after dinner i did press the loght twice to indicate my need and nothing happened at dinner there wa no tea service i did get up and go to the galley and ask for a cup of tea there wa no hand soap in the washroom however on my way to london from toronto my experience wa a good one however it wa not the same on my return flight,positive
the service wa excellent the cabin staff were attentive and efficient the food and drink were very good the seat in the new suite is extremely comfortable and the additional privacy is really nice overall a very enjoyable flight,positive
i booked and paid for what i thought wa a business class seat on a flight to athens what i got wa a premium economy seat the first nine row were business class seat row to were what should have been the premium economy cabin but had been added to the business class section which had less comfortable seat that didn t fully recline unlike the seat in row to i wa in row this is not a case of me being snobby but simply a point of principle and a clear case of ba mi selling had i known prior that i would be paying the same business class price but for seat that were less comfortable than other business class passenger on the same flight i wouldn t have booked i complained on board along with several other passenger who also resented being scammed in that way i also made a formal complaint to ba but wa fobbed off apparently this is a long running scam i don t know how they get away with it,negative
terrible customer service booked my flight before covid couldn t go still can t go a border are still closed i wasn t given an option just told i have to take a voucher now i have no job and no plan to travel and they refuse to give me my money back although i booked for a flight for cayman and i still haven t been able to go they cannot provide the service i paid for and refuse to refund me they are not sympathetic or understanding the voucher is valid for another two year i wonder how many flight will go up by then i wonder how many more regulation there will be i ve been such a good customer and feel i deserve better,negative
this wa my first flight during the pandemic so it wa understandable the difficulty facing airline check in wa longer than normal due to the vaccine check and passenger locator form etc but on the return flight it wa a total mess just two counter open for economy and one for business there were argument regarding vaccine check where two ba staff were contradicting each other it took an hour and ten minute just to check in resulting in the flight delay on board i wa not expecting great service seating wa extremely uncomfortable inch pitch and inch wide seat just about bearable for an hour and a half flight on board service wa a packet of crisp and a small bottle of water from another no eye contact with me just handed out however i wa pleased that disembarking passenger were let out in group despite a few idiot who decided to stand a up to get their hand luggage out while the aircraft is wa still taxing to the gate the cabin crew did manage to force them back to their seat and close the locker,negative
lca to lhr in club europe quick check in at lca with speedy passport control and security aspire lounge wa clean and spacious with reasonable buffet food and drink boarding by group and pushback on time ce stretched back a full row and the single toilet struggled drink and meal service wa efficient despite the many row but the vegetarian option wa the usual pasta splodge and reminiscent of economy of yore onboard w fi wa adequate if rather slow and it shouldn t be charged for in business class arrival ahead of schedule disembarking en masse and through e gate surprisingly quickly overall a flight that wa typical of the post covid standard for short haul business class,positive
i had booked a flight from heathrow on friday th august to fly to manchester airport on arrival at heathrow to check in the british airway staff informed me that i had booked both flight seat in my name by mistake i offered to pay a fee to get the second seat changed to my sister s name but british airway refused u to board and sent u home however the staff member who i spoke to at the desk promised to email u flight voucher which i would get shortly so that i could fly at another time with ba since they do not offer refund i never received these flight voucher i have chased numerous time on the phone with ba staff who said that it wa my error and that no flight voucher would be sent to me they have no record that a staff member spoke to me and promised these voucher they say i wa just a no show which is inaccurate i have sent numerous email to ba explaining what happened and asking form my promised voucher i have had no response to my email message one ba staff member on the phone said that i should track down the lady i spoke to at heathrow and ask her if she remembers me so ludicrous a i did not take her name and i doubt she would remember me since she see hundred of ba customer a day,negative
we have flown with ba for many year and never will again where there is an alternative booked and paid for club class flight didn t receive a meal or drink onboard crew were so unorganised we were delayed on the ground for minute prior to departing so they had plenty of time to prepare but the in flight service wa delayed once up in the air they commenced the service albeit very slowly then abandoned it and closed the service altogether the crew never even had the decency to speak to u to apologise in person or even over the tannoy complained to ba and received an apology by email with the usual we fell short of our standard generic speech but no offer of any partial refund or avios to compensate for the lack of service,negative
the crew at denver airport is top notch so impressed with their customer service they were very patient and courteous thank you all for being amazing,positive
an ordinary ba domestic shuttle flight from belfast to london heathrow usually uneventful except for the cabin crew announcement three time advising people complete a uk passenger arrival form from the gov uk website or risk prosecution some people challenged this statement and were rebuked ba cabin crew were adamant that this wa now a requirement but the regular traveller amongst u knew this wa incorrect advice some people were anxious departing the aircraft other than that crisp snack and water were offered which is a nice touch sky cafe still not on sale not quite sure why given covid protocol in the uk are mainly relaxed now ba is still by far the best operator from ulster to england,positive
i ve had to book six flight with ba recently all have either been cancelled or had a significant time change the latest flight wa so late into heathrow we missed our connecting flight even though we d scheduled around hour between flight ba staff at heathrow were rude and generally clueless for the most part they couldn t get u to our destination within hour of our scheduled arrival time we booked an easyjet flight from gatwick instead and had to pay to get ourselves to gatwick a complaint wa registered several week ago with no response so far perhaps ba have a backlog of complaint the way they are performing at the moment it s an embarrassment that our national flag carrier is being comfortably out performed by budget airline but that appears to be the case at the moment,negative
the service is got super inconsistent on ba and the management of our diverted flight wa unprofessional and lacked any shred of empathy the flight down from london i wa in business class i asked for the mini bottle of champagne that i always treat myself to the cabin crew member said i can t give you the bottle only a glass however the other crew member wa giving bottle to other passenger in row one and two we were in i asked for a top up and staff said not until they were finished the business cabin in case they would run out the crew should not pick and choose one passenger over another and change the service that is not fair we got diverted a volcano ash wa impacting tenerife we needed to refuel at gran canaria min from tenerife but we were diverted to malaga we got an e mail clearly stating meal and accommodation the crew also said the same we got to the hotel and no dinner for u and there wa no room service breakfast wa at eight but our bus to the airport wa also at eight all we could do at wa to grab something from the buffet and run to the coach i have been on diverted flight before we got dinner and breakfast,positive
such terrible service in club world such indifference and lackadaisical attitude hardly any service everything ha to be asked for and gotten asked for a cup of tea and had the flight say whaa and then when i said cup of tea she said yes asked if wanted milk and sugar brought to me lukewarm tea with sugar sachet no spoon or stirrer pushed the bell for stirrer and had to wait a full min before someone came by eventually for a spoon and had to drink cold tea seriously ba what are you doing is this how you welcome back people to fly,negative
lhr to lca gallery lounge chock a block first thing on a wednesday morning and t seemed a bustling a pre pandemic boarding by group efficient and flight almost full superficially the cabin seemed clean although long hair on pillow gave the game away expanded club europe stretching back row the new norm departure on time good drink service which sequed smoothly into lunch post covid lunch remains restricted do co must be horrified by what they re having to produce miniscule salad and the worst gnocchi dish i ve ever tasted wi fi access wasn t free for business class passenger for an hour of intermittent service is excessive arrival ahead of schedule and no issue with passport control at lca,negative
very pleasant flight to lisbon it wa a full flight and we left about min late a we were taken to the aircraft by bus at heathrow and the gate staff allow too much hand luggage to the aircraft however in the air great service by the male crew on a big club class cabin friendly and efficient crew even to some demanding and obnoxious passenger late breakfast brunch served wa tasty what a contrast to the iberia crew lisbon madrid london who were cold and unprofessional,positive

i think british airway need to be much clearer about what their covid travel flexibility really mean because it doesn t pas the common sense test i purchased a round trip business class ticket from new york to and from mykonos through london i traveled there with no problem the day before my return to new york though i took my covid test and learned that i tested positive i tried to call the airline on the many usless number they provide on their website the recorded message drone on and on about how they have no one to answer the phone because of covid safety and simply say therefore we can t answer your call try again no ability to leave a call back number or a voicemail etc for whatever reason the ba website thought that i had bought the ticket through a third party agent i did not i bought it on ba com and so wouldnt let me cancel or reschedule the flight on the web site i called and called over the coming day and could not get through to the london athens or new york line two day later after having negative pcr test the most accurate test i learned i wa not positive and so had to buy a new return flight to the u s i ve now been calling the ba usa customer service line for nearly a month at least every other day never to get through finally did and have been told that the fact that i couldnt get on the flight because of a covid scare count for nothing the fact they dont have enough people answering the phone count for nothing or that i wa unable to change the flight to a few day later on the web site becuase the ticket wa mi booked they have offered that if i send them a greek doctor s note saying that i wa sick then they ll give me a voucher for a future flight from mykonos to new york i am speechless at the stupidity of this whole situation,negative
my flight from boston to heathrow arrived in time but i and other passenger were not allowed to disembark the plane we were kept in the tarmac for one hour and a half without being given sufficient information about what wa causing this delay because of this delay i and other passenger lost the connecting flight to tirana i wa offered another connecting flight which wa hour later from the time of arrival when i booked this flight one of the main reason that made me choose it wa the fact that the layover wa a little bit more than an hour turning it into an hour layover i think is unacceptable and very poor customer service it show lack of respect for your client and lack of commitment by this company to provide to their customer what they were promised and what they paid for i am very disappointed by this experience,negative
year after year the british airway ba service on the same route washington london is becoming worse we just had one bad experience after another on this route in july british airway ba notified u that our connection flight to nice wa bumped from pm to pm so we had to spend an extra hour in the airport during this covid era their website and email prior to our day of flight kept asking u to check uk gov for the covid rule and regulation for transit through london which said that no covid test wa necessary if we could show proof of vaccine however upon our arrival at the airport they told u we needed to go to the basement to take a covid test to show negative result they charged u per person for a rapid covid test which wa an outrage and totally unnecessary we could have gotten the test done at a cheaper rate had we known that this wa a requirement prior to our flight food service wa horrible they served food with lot of cheese to me while i had requested a vegan meal due to may dairy allergy ba damaged our samsonite luggage and they told u at the airport that we needed to report this online we have been trying to resolve this issue since july and after asking u for photo like time they are still giving u the run around,negative
ba used to be my go to carrier and i am a silver member however their service seems to have gone hugely downhill flight get cancelled the best alternative flight are offered and whilst in theory you can cancel or amend booking online or on the app invariably this is not possible you cannot contact them by email and you may find yourself sitting on a phone for plus minute to speak to someone if they are busy due to cancelled flight they need to employ people to answer call and email promptly i wa stunned by the recent cancellation to my catania flight two week before i wa due to travel,negative
the entertainment system wa working badly the screen wa freezing every time i wanted to open flight map though the aircraft wa year only the window blind worked with delay the crew informed passenger that there would be no headphone provided a it wa supposed to be a short haul flight after flying with aeroflot and s airline i expected to receive an excellent ba service but i got only a pack of crisp and a tiny bottle of water i think it s unacceptable for a non low cost carrier to offer service like this i can get that hot meal on board are now rare i loved the most comfortable seat in my life i tend to have problem with sleeping on board but this time i didn t even noticed my falling asleep right after takeoff,positive
i flew on british airway cheapest fare which wa a hand baggage only fare in economy class despite this being the cheapest fare you can actually carry two piece of cabin luggage both weighing up to kg each the value for money here is incredible the ground staff at london heathrow are very polite and helpful the plane wa clean and the cabin crew were very smiley and polite this wa a short haul flight but we were given a free packet of crisp and a bottle of water there wa wifi onboard which we paid for the full flight access package and it wa great it wa fast enough to stream a movie on netflix if you are considering between a low cost carrier and a premium carrier like ba pay the extra and fly with the premium carrier with the generous cabin luggage allowance and the free snack on board it may end up being cheaper and nobody clap when the plane land,positive

for this flight from heathrow t passenger were piled into the bus and left for min at the terminal very unhappy passenger and when confronted the ba transport manager s response wa sorry we are still learning on arrival at the aircraft a gentleman who came on a wheelchair had no help with his luggage i helped shame since lounge service wa very good for the flight out from munich ba had not re signed up to the now open lounge in munich to me look like a systemic failing rather than a one off event,negative
ba encourage you to download verifly to speed up your check in this is absolutely rubbish a the desk staff don t seem to want this they want to see the actual form test etc this wasted about minute and is pointless the return flight again had no access to the club lounge you pay for extra such a this a part of the business class ticket price and should by now be made available again last flight not available at nce but this is more a part of the covid experience on board staff were good although one did joke to another welcome to ryanair on board food wa very good for a short haul flight,positive

i usually avoid ba because of it appalling customer service and sneaky extra charge but this flight wa my only option note that ba actually charge for seat pre selection in biz class uk pound in this case doe any other airline in the world dare do that i saved the money and waited until checkin to choose my seat for free the seat were ba s universally derided cramped across back to front configuration where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arm s length away no other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement i wonder why no preflight drink wa offered at meal time i selected one of the three main offering only to be told it wasn t available even though there were only people in my seat biz section the seat area ha practically no storage except a tiny drawer at ankle level that is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position the bed is the narrowest i have experienced in biz class and is also very hard the cabin wa very cold and the blanket very thin i had to raid blanket from two other seat just to stay warm the amenity kit is the smallest i ve ever seen in biz class it fit in the palm of the hand all in all this uncomfortable miserly experience is hardly worth the that ba charge for this route i used mile to pay for my ticket but of course got whacked with ba s unique and notorious fuel surcharge fee of for using mile,negative
aktion airport ha only recently opened it new facility and check in and departure certainly seemed very clean and efficient although admittedly it s only having to cope with a low passenger load at present it wa good to see that check in carefully scrutinised lateral flow certificate and passenger locator form thanks to just passenger on board with more than half in club europe the flight took off ahead of time service wa a little perfunctory and the food wa more reminiscent of economy than business class with too much pre packaging the covid effect presumably arrival into t wa also comfortably ahead of schedule and although we were dreading many hour of queuing at border control we were through the e gate and collecting our luggage just minute after landing,positive

after sixteen month of being grounded by covid it felt almost surreal to be back in t heading for what to u wa essential summer sun in greece t wa blissfully quiet with no queue at check in or security and even the gallery south lounge wa less frenetic than usual despite family with kid similarly desperate to escape boris johnson s bully boy attitude ordering food and beverage from one s table seems something worth continuing avoiding all the wastage of endlessly replenished buffet the flight wa very quiet with just pax on board of whom were in club europe boarding by row also seemed a welcome improvement on the previous group service on the flight wa good and the food wa of the usual do co quality landing wa ahead of schedule and we were through passport control in just a few minute after a quick check of vaccination certificate and the passenger locator form overall a thoroughly reassuring coming out of covid experience,positive

this wa not my best experience with ba thus far a there were a couple of disappointment i wa happy with the fast baggage check in this wa a bus gate which is not my favourite thing but not a blemish on the airline the covid protocol are not a robust a they should be particularly attendant need to be armed with sanitizer at the cabin entrance there wa a big mix up which i find inexcusable i and another passenger were allocated the same seat on the same plane causing a few anxious moment and the friendly attendant had to get me another seat but i don t expect such at this level bottle of water were offered to every passenger which wa welcome the plane arrived minute late,positive

i wa travelling back from mexico city on a business trip fully aware of the covid safety restriction at the moment which the staff do an admirable job with but nevertheless a lot to say on the state of ba first at the moment firstly no lounge at all at mexico city terminal there s a paid lounge but the check in staff wouldn t help with the detail mexico city terminal ha functional lounge for aeromexico working not good enough for an expensive ticket finally got to board and the staff are incredible but throughout they were super apologetic a to what wa to come the food wa literally inedible in first and staff offered commented a much every time so for an hour trip in first the option really wa chocolate or crisp the first suite on the flight had visible sign of wear and tear and need some attention the seat would not easily convert to a bed it had scuff mark around it and generally looked a bit shabby again not what you d expect from a premium product i left my watch on the flight in error and contacted ba immediately about this despite assurance that they have a comprehensive cleaning process during covid my watch wa never found ba ha outsourced their lost and found service to a separate company and in the process they have completely washed their hand on helping out customer given that i told them specifically where i d left the watch i can only assume that one of the cleaning staff decided to keep it all in all you pay premium on a flight for additional service ba isn t offering it at the moment if it is essential that you have to fly really don t bother with first unless you have to or go to another airline the company just don t care,positive

good service the whole way nothing exceptional but it wa only a short flight plane wa clean and refreshment were provided my only issue is that the flight wa packed understandable a it wa just before chirstmas but surely it is not wise to have stranger sitting so close to each other during a pandemic even with the mask my return flight wa cancelled but it wa easy to transfer to a new flight so no issue there either just hoping for a little more personal space next time also wi fi did not work i also liked that they had a system for boarding and disembarking to avoid everyone rushing at the same time brought in for the pandemic i m sure but i hope this is something they continue into the future a it made the experience much more pleasant value for money marked down only because the christmas flight were so expensive to be expected though i know,positive

overall i have to say i am really pleased with the service ba provided given the circumstance which must be particularly challenging for airline i had to call ba a few time regarding both my outbound and return flight and i would rate their customer service everyone i talked to wa extremely friendly and helpful one employee even tried to help me figure out the recently updated arrival regulation from an italian website and listened to my rant about constantly changing restriction and quarantine i wa refunded promptly for part of my flight that had been cancelled and i wa able to change my return flight to a completely different route and date with only a minimal charge they have really shown flexibility here which is needed when travelling in the flight itself wa fine and i appreciate that food and drink option are currently a bit limited given that everyone should wear their mask a much a possible rather than sipping tea the one thing which i mean a constructive criticism though i think ba could improve is a little more exchange with their destination airport the arrival sheet for italy we were given on the flight were outdated and the ground staff in heathrow in charge of the boarding procedure did not even know that swab test were now mandatory for arrival in italy when i asked him whether he knew any detail of what to expect in venice that s fine on the first day after yet another update but this rule had been in place for day on the day i travelled overall my experience with ba wa very positive though and i am happy to spend a little more on my flight than i would with some cheaper airline for the great customer service i received,positive

my flight from los angeles to paris via london wa delayed due to late inbound aircraft due to mechanical and so i missed my connexion in london and arrived in paris late and missed my onward connexion on air france and had to overnight on my own dime in paris i applied for compensation lawfully due me through ec but their customer relation department refused by carelessly determining that my flight had arrived in london under the hour delay window for compensation even though my final wa clearly paris and their cr agent acknowledged this after i pointed out the error she ignored me so i filed a claim with the centre for effective dispute resolution and ba sent them a defence they claim i traveled on af and arrived in london ahead of schedule the truth is that ba at lax rebooked and reticketed me on that flight however af refused to accept me and my baggage unless i paid them a surcharge so ba then rebooked me on flight to have me arrive very late into paris and misconnect and have to overnight there i do not know which is more shocking that ba would lie to the authority in order to support their indefensible position or that their agent do not know how to read a passenger name record s air history,negative
i wa deeply unimpressed with the lack of social distancing on my flight the plane to london wa or more full and no social distancing could be applied a number of people wearing face mask incorrectly over mouth or a a chinstrap throughout the flight and there wa a fair amount of time when mask were off for the free snack small bag of crisp and ml of water it seems crazy to allow a considerate amount of time with mask off or inappropriately worn in such a small space with no safe distance whatsoever also only the absolute minimum of service which given covid is understandable but make the flight really boring or not since some excitement wa provided by turbulence with very little information from the flight deck disembarkation wa chaotic to say the least but terminal wa empty and vast enough to allow to finally distance an upgrade for euro one wa wa available but it didn t seem to make sense at least they departed on time and the plane appeared reasonably clean,negative

during the time of covid it is normal that a airline ha to cancel their flight i m ok with that also when it mean that i had to reorganize a few thing what s definitely is not okay is the compensation via voucher you can t use their voucher online or for a cheap flight on the hotline they offer you no online fare and just way more expensive price so stay far away from their voucher for me a a regular traveler i will avoid ba a much a possible in the future i even won t use my mile with ba,positive

i booked my flight to the uk in may and had to cancel our trip to the uk on march day prior to leaving because a travel ban wa going to start on march and because i am older and have pre existing health condition my doctor asked me to postpone our trip the british airway customer care associate i talked with were great and caring and they were able to issue u travel credit for ticket that were non refundable now the problem is i need to rebook and use the travel credit by may for travel to the uk by may or lose all the credit from our trip how can i make travel arrangement by may with the coronavirus out of control throughout the world and travel ban in place i understand ba ha policy in place but i cannot understand how you can expect someone to make travel arrangement while the world is dealing with covid i feel this timeline is unfair to any consumer who ha trust with their preferred airline my preferred airline is still british airway british airway need to reevaluate their policy during a world crisis and make adjustment a needed to be fair to consumer who trust them whether a consumer ha purchased refundable or non refundable ticket should not matter because forcing a consumer to rebook while a world pandemic is happening and not adjusting your policy to the situation can change your loyal customer remember there are many other airline out there to choose from the coronavirus is something that no one ha any control of i guess the bottom line is i think british airway need to put some common sense to their policy i want to rebook and travel but i am hesitant to this at this time hopefully may this pandemic is over for all of u,positive

the first thing is the shortage of staff the business cabin is quite large and eight across and seem to be serviced by one or two people each side it meant that the drink after takeoff did not appear for an hour after the order wa taken unfortunately although they were pleasant the staff were not up to the mark and appeared very undertrained i asked a young man to turn on the reading light and he claimed there weren t any i showed him the one by my seat and after fiddling with it he said it must be broken at the end of the flight i discovered the switch despite being a newly configured plane the dividing screen kept dropping i had to ask for a cup of tea time there wa only a choice of two red and two white wine and considering the number of people in the business section i cannot understand why they would not offer a third there wa port on the menu but wa never offered with cheese every time the next course came out the setting wa not ready to accept it due to plate and glass from previous course many people had clutter uncleared for an hour after end of meal most of the course were quite small portion and by the end of the meal i wa ready for a mini snack i am not a big eater but i wa peckish the layout of the business cabin is cramped i am and i could not stretch out the seat and legroom are extremely narrow and people in the centre two row and the window seat have to climb over other passenger this mean no one ha a easy seat you either have to climb or be climbed over i wonder how they can expect such a bad design to be accepted in the business market i travel on many airline in business and ba is still the bottom of the pile and reluctantly the last one i would use the centre and window seat have their food and drink served effectively through the service hatch across other customer unfortunately upon arrival at bridgetown the ba team didn t get any better after one hour minute of waiting for my fast tracked luggage i approached a guy wearing a ba tabard and he just shrugged his shoulder i then found another guy who worked for the ground staff and he went outside and found about case sitting by the tarmac doing nothing,negative

london to johannesburg with british airway ba s b gate lounge is a rather more civilised place to pas time than the gallery lounge in the main terminal it s also a tad closer on the transit or via the rather useful walkway on level to the c gate where the a s depart from the new boarding by group meant snaking queue but at least group moved fairly speedily the club world were still the same much maligned seat with the small unresponsive ife screen and limited selection of film the dinner service wa slow because of the unwise introduction of individual tray brought to each seat trolley may lack glamour but one doe get off to sleep quicker on an overnight flight breakfast wa adequate but nothing more landing wa exactly on time overall a reasonable flight but the inflight service wa distinctly average,positive

we have had some torrid experience with ba which we have not been shy to report so when we flew yesterday with them from heathrow to austin and had a great flight in every way it felt right to feedback on that the staff in the upstairs business class cabin were frankly wonderful cheerful efficient and calm what more could you ask the food wa pretty nice and the champagne lovely the bed were very comfortable and sleeping wa easy i literally cannot think of any real negative the luggage locker were quite small but then it s an older model of the plane so that probably explains it if only ba could deliver this kind of experience on every occasion they would once again be the world s favourite airline sadly the current ceo doesn t seem able to inspire and motivate his staff to be consistently delightful perhaps once he move on we can expect something better although the flight wa a bit delayed on departure it arrives bang on time a we entered the literally empty immigration area we were met by the most charming custom officer you can imagine who ended up giving u tourist tip and idea for bar surreal a anyone who regularly travel to the state will testify it felt a if we were living in the truman show at one point but in the nicest possible way get yourselves down to good ole austin now that ba fly there direct fantastic,positive

having booked this flight a week before the ba strike and mistakingly thinking that the strike would have ended two day before i flew and not in fact the day before i wa apprehensive a to how it would operate the check in and security clearance at t took only minute personally i do not like the self service bag and tag drop that ba operate a one is not confident that i did everything correctly boarding is by the new fare group system to which depends on how much one ha paid for the ticket again i m not a fan of this possibly due to the previous day s strike and the need to accommodate passenger from canceled flight the aircraft wa a large a boarding wa however smooth on board the virtually full cabin wa very clean and the eurotraveller seat were comfortable and offer sufficient leg room i m m cm and my knee do not touch the seat in front the departure wa only minute behind the scheduled departure time in flight there were cabin staff in the euro traveller cabin believe in club cabin who were very efficient and friendly and so one only had to wait no more than minute from take off to purchase refreshment on such a full flight again it is a shame though that ba have gone down the no frill line and charge for food and drink when they describe themselves a a full service airline the landing at tegel wa minute ahead of schedule all in all it wa a pleasant flight and the value wa very good a it wa combined with a hotel booking tegel itself is a bit of hassle with only border police carrying out immigration control for over passenger at the end of the airbridge and a further minute wait for luggage but this wa not ba s fault,positive

london to johannesburg british airway is one of the few commercial carrier in the world that charge an exorbitant amount in fee when booking travel but in addition if you want to ensure you and your spouse will sit together on the flight you need to pay a high price to secure seat assignment with that said in my wife and i made reservation on ba to fly to johannesburg from london for an african adventure this october specifically yes that s the day called for brexit only we made our reservation before those date were set considering ba pilot have called for three pilot strike on september coupled with brexit we decided to change our flight plan because we did not want to risk missing our connection the good news is close to in fee for our two business class ticket wa refunded when i changed our flight to another carrier through american airline advantage the bad news is the we had to pay to reserve our seat wa not refunded i called ba to request a refund and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat reservation expense i wa just not feeling the love here so i am writing this missive to warn anyone traveling abroad to not fly british airway all of the other outstanding carrier don t charge nearly the high fee and most don t charge for reserving your seat in advance instead of ba we changed our booking to on etihad airway through abu dhabi their customer service wa outstanding the fee were lower and yes no charge to have the peace of mind that my wife and i can travel next to each other i am entering travel in september because there wa no other option for future travel this request for a refund come two month in advance of our planned flight this is an airline policy review and let the buyer beware,positive
i have to say travelling in club europe is a waste of money the food wa no better than economy food from the past the seat are just the same a in economy although you get a middle tray and probably worst of all the cabin wa full of a lot of arrogant people who thought that just because they were not in economy it somehow made them more worthy people this might be a british trait a i ve travelled business class on other airline and not had the same experience,negative

london to nice i agree totally with the comment made in michael croft s review today my flight to nice wa cancelled a a result of the low cost and unreliable it system that ba have while the senior management are likely celebrating somewhere that they managed to cut more cost the handling of the situation at heathrow wa despicable and you would think that with all the failure that ba encounter these day they would have got this part of their act together they make out such a problem is a bolt from the blue when clearly they have not been investing where they should instead focussing on cost cutting to boost their performance bonus not just the ceo should go but some others at the top,positive
palma to london heathrow how doe british airway get away with having such a useless it system and presumably team of it staff management these issue recur on such a frequent basis it is now time for some head to roll preferably from the ceo down just read a fatuously stupid interview with alex cruz talking about how his child are guiding him on the future of air travel when this man cannot manage to run the airline properly in let alone try to make himself look all eco friendly with such comment i have been a loyal customer for over year and it seems that ba have not the slightest interest in those of u that pay full fare and have been through all the low of ba without complaint until now my patience ha run out,negative

london to faro we booked our ticket family of two month before the flight with british airway so we could enjoy the quality and the service so we thought inbound flight seat ha been booked and paid quite high amount for seat for the row and outbound flight row and two week before the flight without any warning and email from british airway we ve found out that our seat ha been moved to unlucky inbound and to a outbound they ve split all family quite far away apart from each other a well customer service ha hang up on u for the first time and second phone call ha promised to call back but never did will i ever over pay difference so i can have good customer service with british airway ever again the answer is no i am extremely upset that our seat ha been given away to someone else for no reason disappointed and you can no longer rely on british airway,negative

johannesburg to cape town return this flight wa operated by comair and thus it wa quite different from a normal british airway flight in europe check in at the priority line wa uneventful however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that oneworld sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if i wa flying business johannesburg airport and cape town s domestic terminal is laid out very similarly their lounge called slow is actually impressive although there wa no full english on offer unlike the british airway gallery lounge in other place there wa a substantial amount of savoury snack pastry and small bite they even had a coffee counter with made to order drink i assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol very impressive for a domestic business class lounge priority boarding wa honoured and boarding wa an orderly process i would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row a there is actually ton of legroom in front i reserved an exit row and paid an extra per exit row during the booking these seat were old and plush however i do prefer the newer leather seat used on their european aircraft a those offer better support i had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seat in a x configuration i did not expect this a business class in europe is normally just a blocked middle seat there were several drink service on this two hour flight and a hot breakfast with either a bacon sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetable option needless to say a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated it wa also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh the crew were very friendly making casual joke and giving a down to earth friendliness you rarely get on airline these day they were quite rushed but understandable due to the short flight time in cape town airport it wa actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stair for passenger to deplane board but since it took only minute to board a rather full it work and make sense i think that this flight ha improved my opinion on british airway and they were the same price a the competition south african airway i would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on africa s busiest air route for the price paid i d be happy to fly them again,positive
grenada to gatwick having flown with ba on this aircraft type prior to refurbishment i wa intrigued to experience the change to the cabin the cabin wa much smarter previous aircraft have looked very tired and the lighting wa pleasant the entertainment system wa hugely improved with a good selection of medium on larger touch screen device i suppose the reason i appreciated this wa because the old system were so hopelessly outdated but the family really found them entertaining for me the real issue wa the tight leg room i am a slim ft and now the lack of seat width made it almost impossible to eat a meal it wa for me very tight previously the seat format wa it is now we were sat in the outbound although on return we sat near the back of economy where the aircraft narrow and seat become we sat in a which wa more bearable i also found the seat really hard after a couple of hour although sitting on the supplied back rest cushion helped a bit despite best effort to sleep i failed i remember the old seat being more comfortable especially for long haul service wa professional and timely and food wa similar to previous flight edible in summary it seems a shame that ba have improved some aspect of the experience but seat comfort ha been sacrificed which is a great pity,positive

i wa seated right next to the galley and lavatory in the aisle during the safety talk the cabin crew were only metre away talking loudly which wa irritating so my initial impression wa disappointed for business class however into the flight i found one female crew very personable and wa offered a seat two back i wa not provided with a complimentary travel wallet so did not realise that sock and sleep mask were available and i needed to ask for a pillow the menu guide wa on cheap paper and with no convenient place to store it for reference later wa very ordinary the evening meal wa acceptable soup steak veg fruit wa ok served with freezing cold cutlery bed wa ok but nowhere to store spectacle or personal need such a spectacle asthma puffer or water bottle the breakfast of juice and cereal yoghurt wa fine but the single poached egg wa like a rubber ball and the included fish patty were unpalatable the lavatory wa spacious and allowed room to change clothes ready for the connecting flight overall i expected a better level of attention to detail and a more upmarket delivery the only business class addition feature that i appreciated wa being able to stretch out for some sleep ba ground staff were unable to link my second flight on a qf from singapore to brisbane insisting i needed to collect my luggage leave arrival and recheck in for next flight i am with some mobility problem requiring assistance so this wa a worry for me when i arrived in singapore the kind assistance girl arranged to take me to a special transit desk where it wa no problem arranging for my bag to be forwarded to next flight,positive
flight wa ok minor delay didn t both me what wa astonishing is that we had to wait an hour or so to drop off our luggage because at lyon airport they were training new ground staff at the same time they continued doing this even though the cue became pretty huge and time started to run out to make it to the flight,positive
gatwick to barbados return i normally travel on ba with low expectation with the result that i am not too disappointed and sometimes pleasantly surprised the outbound flight wa about par for the course with a reasonably comfortable seat and an ok cabin crew that did just about enough to look after u and make the flight uneventful however the flight did leave bang on time and managed to land in barbados before the virgin flight that wa scheduled to leave gatwick five minute before u with the result that we got through arrival quickly the return flight a week later managed to reinforce my low expectation of ba with one of the poorer flight that we have experienced over the last few year once again when you travel west to east the crew specifically one lady who wa looking after our part of the cabin somehow feel they have to rush through every part of the drink and meal service that it becomes an ordeal the pre departure drink were missed on all of seat on the left hand side of the pe cabin not a big deal but irritating non the less no bread wa served with dinner despite there being butter on the plate so i presume it wa missed my wife had ordered a veggie meal and wa served about ten minute before everyone else which wa fine however a the crew were serving the remaining meal there wa a continual dialogue across the two aisle about what selection they each had on their respective trolley when they reached our row they somehow thought it would be a good idea to try and pas a hot tray of chicken in gravy across the four middle seat with the result that the red hot gravy spilled on the my wife s remaining food and lap although fortunately she did have a napkin in place which absorbed most of the liquid it also spilled on my kindle which thankfully had the cover closed a very brief apology wa given but without any sincerity and i suspect blissfully unaware of the obvious mistake they had made my wife s wine wa replaced but not the rest of her dinner once again we landed on time which wa a good thing overall the return flight wa extremely poor,positive
marseille to london i am generally annoyed with the quality of the service i believe that we should not have to pay for a glass of water with slice of lemon in a ba flight i realised that i forgot a big duty free bag in the plane after the passport control i went to the ba helpdesk the staff sent me to terminal at the lost and found to pick up my bag while it wa not even there luckily i decided to stop on the way in the lost and found of terminal where they the friendly lost and found staff and not the ba staff nicely explained me that there wa no point for me to go there and called some other agent to help me,negative

gatwick to malaga check in wa fairly quick the check in area at gatwick is quite nice although they are failing with general upkeep the whole area needed vacuuming and there were stain and sign of chewing gum on the carpet if you re not going to look after it then you better just having normal airport flooring the lounge at gatwick is really nice and whilst it wa very busy there were still available comfy and desk style chair to suit the food and drink offering wa very good tasty and varied on board i wa lucky to be able to book the exit row which actually make the seat better than club in my opinion food and drink service wa fairly slow although being near the front this wasn t a problem for me the food offering is fairly poor really a couple of sandwich or snack drink selection is better what wa very nice wa near the end of the flight i wa given a free glass of champagne for being a silver member i wouldn t expect this and i m sure it s just because they had a bottle to use up but it wa a nice gesture to show to frequent flyer still no wifi or wifi based in flight entertainment offered priority bag tag a usual are kind of irrelevant my bag took quite a long time to come through and wa preceded by dozen of non priority bag overall a decent flight and very good value a i paid using avios being silver and getting lounge access and free seat selection wa a massive plus,positive
boston to london heathrow wa excited to experience a for the first time paid a steep for the seat selection on the upper deck wa very comfortable with storage cabin beneath the window seat itself wa the standard one comfortable the boarding wa efficiently managed for such a large aircraft there wa never a massive crowd in front of the gate the inflight service for the outbound leg wa less than ideal the food wa very mediocre at best not worth losing sleep over it there wa serious bump along the way midflight the a being so massive easily absorbed it return wa on a b flight wa not full but almost full the inflight service and the food served were both remarkably better than the outbound journey the baggage drop area however wa a disaster none of the machine worked and there wa single kind hearted person assisting passenger the boarding wa again very orderly both outbound and inbound ife wa good but not a good a some long haul carrier if both leg had similar cabin crew and food i would have scored them higher,positive
london to cape town in first and our first taste of the new soft product still unfortunately a year old that hadn t had it refurbishment and wa showing it age a wardrobe door that s falling off it hinge a non touch touch screen and a cupboard door in the washroom that won t stay shut don t pas muster in first and blemish the impression of the positive change in the on board service the young mixed fleet crew did a reasonable job and served drink and food efficiently without the wait other reviewer have complained about care wa also taken in preparing and plating up the food for once nothing wa overcooked and even the beef wa decent bedding is also improved with a good quality duvet and large pillow the ife remains the same low re screen quality and the new headphone are uncomfortable worn for more than the duration of a single film the goody bag is much better and worth taking home overall a pretty good flight but it remains to be seen what ba will do with it long in the tooth first class when their new club suite are launched,positive
this review is specifically aimed at the excellent cabin crew on ba from jfk new york to heathrow on tue th may i wa travelling back from new york following a few day break with girlfriend check in and boarding wa all on schedule however it wa identified that there wa a technical problem and the captain advised passenger that some assistance wa required to rectify the issue this resulted in over an hour s delay leaving ny despite this annoying delay the cabin crew more than made up for this they were friendly polite and couldn t do enough to ensure our journey wa comfortable and enjoyable they were all exceptional even those that were not serving in the section i wa in i do hope that this information is passed on,positive

washington to london having travelled out to washington from heathrow on first class i wasn t overly impressed although the concorde room wa relaxing and comfortable the bar staff were a mixture of attentive and somewhat dismissive the cabin crew were polite but quite surgical in their manner which gave an overall impression of a cold and clinical approach my return journey couldn t have been more different the ba lounge wa very well presented with a fantastic choice of both food and drink but the hi light of my return flight were the engaging nature of the cabin crew nothing short of amazing i wa offered the usual amenity upon boarding but what set this flight apart from the start wa the very happy and friendly nature of the crew absolutely nothing wa too much trouble and they took the time to chat with me and showed a real general interest in what we talked about demeanour wa perfect with both a very professional yet relaxing and engaging approach a fantastic sense of humour and seemed genuinely delighted to assist having had mixed level of service with ba and always flying virgin i think ba need to track down this staff member and use her a the model for all future cabin crew training,positive

bucharest to london my flight with british airway wa hour delayed from a european destination to london i applied for compensation for this delay initially i wa informed that under eu regulation i would receive euro compensation to be informed day later that this wa an error and that i wa no longer getting compensated british airway argued that sickness of a crew member is considered extraordinary circumstance comparable with weather issue and that therefore they do not have to compensate passenger for this flight however there are court precedence case that clearly show that crew sickness is not to be considered an extraordinary circumstance and that it is in an airline responsibility to have a contingency strategy for such case or compensate if they do not i have talked to the manager of customer service and wa told that there is nothing they can do a this is their policy i believe that if not on legal basis british airway should have compensated out of customer service reason because a hour delay within europe is significant many time i picked to fly with british airway based on the expectation of good customer service in the case of anything going wrong but this experience proved to me that it s not worth investing that extra money into flying with british airway,negative

london to doha similar to our outbound flight the seat are comfortable but behind the competition very small storage area if you are tall try sleeping sitting up or in the cradle position a the bed is just not long enough the food portion seems like you are forced to go on a diet though the taste wa ok the entertainment system had the worst selection of any airline i have flown lately but their check in baggage policy make them a very attractive option when you see what their opposition charge for excess luggage,positive

larnaca to london this a is totally unsuitable for a flight of this length the seat pitch and width are the same for economy and club having paid for my flight it s disgraceful on flight where you are sitting for more than hour in an expensive club europe seat the personal space is so tight if the person in front reclined their seat it s a nightmare the seat in the middle is blocked but getting out if the seat in front are reclined is hazardous you pay for a club ticket for space and comfort and get nothing,positive
i booked my ba flight from zurich to london heathrow using avios my frequent flyer number had to be added time during the booking process when i tried to reserve an aisle seat for medical reason the ba website showed that all of the seat had been allocated save for a few seat for which i would have had to pay about thirty pound the check in area for ba at zurich airport is in a hard to find spot of the airport the check in agent wa very professional helpful and informative the area of departure from zurich wa by transfer train the flight boarded in an orderly manner and left more or less on time i wa dismayed to see cabin crew serve alcohol to a group of already drunk german speaking sport fan one of the cabin crew declared that she had run out of beer and then suggested to an increasingly loud and aggressive man that he might like the cider instead in the meantime the same crew member ignored me and other passenger while offering the trolley service the overhead map were not used and the captain made minimal announcement during the flight none of which were in german the flight arrived reasonably promptly,positive

st lucia to gatwick on which my wife and i were both involuntarily downgraded from premium economy to economy due overbooking on the flight it should be noted that at no time wa there any announcement for volunteer for downgrading at vieux fort airport i now know from your cabin crew that it is normal practice for appeal for volunteer to be put over the tannoy system before any enforced downgrade at the time of going through the baggage hall getting our boarding pass we queried them a none had seat number on them to which we were told to just to go through security and our seat would be allocated when we went through the departure gate once in the departure lounge all four of u were tannoyed to return to the baggage hall when we were then told that my wife and i were being downgraded to economy the male telling u this more or less indicated this wa the only way we would be getting on the flight giving u per each on a prepayment card a compensation under article of ec stating however that this did not affect our statutory right he then told u he would find u in the departure lounge and then all four of u had to go through security once again the male who we spoke to in the baggage hall did not come and find u we had to go and find him when he also told me that he had put my wife and i on a row with no other passenger which we assumed rightly or wrongly wa so we could not tell people sitting beside u about the poor service we had received from ba however two other passenger did come and sit beside u with the passenger sitting beside my wife telling her this wa because the seat they had been allocated wa soaking wet and smelt of urine and the cabin crew had asked them to sit on it with a cushion which they had refused and so they were given the seat next to u which wa no problem what further concerned me even more wa one of your cabin crew walking past another passenger with their seat in the reclined position on three separate occasion just prior to approaching gatwick and after the pilot had requested seat belt on and seat in upright position never telling the passenger to raise their seat ba s latest advert celebrates year of ba but for me their service is going backwards the music that accompanies the advert is called salvation and by the end of the flight my wife and i were surely seeking it article of ec regulation is worth reading if this happens to you,positive
chicago to london cancelled flight just a few hour before i left home then put me on a different flight which would have made it impossible to make my connecting flight wa finally put on a different flight on the way home because my first flight wa through american airline and the second through british airway all in the same booking i wa only able to check in and get a seat on the american airline flight a i wa redirected every time to their website couldn t check in for the british airway flight so had to have a middle seat which is very uncomfortable i always check in hour before to guarantee a seat but ba wouldn t allow me to do this,positive

tenerife to heathrow effectively a budget airline masquerading at premium airline price have flown several budget airline in the past which have offered far more in term of value for money and service seat are rigid and i felt a if i wa leaning forward for the the majority of the flight when i tried to put my seat back to recline i estimate it moved around degree leg room is also non existent m s food ran out halfway through the hour flight and although cabin crew were apologetic for food to run out during a lunchtime flight is inexcusable and highlight how badly the airline is being managed by the upper echelon furthermore several other budget airline at the airport had flight leaving directly from the terminal requiring no bussing of passenger ba again in a move to save money opt for bussing passenger to the far reach of the airport to avoid paying extra charge for utilising direct access from airport terminal can t fault the staff onboard who are clearly dedicated to the ba brand they are professional friendly and courteous it s clear that british airway are not the airline they once were and i hope that passenger begin to vote with their foot a drastic change are needed to bring the airline back to it former glory,positive

gatwick to st lucia return recently returned from a two week holiday with my wife in caribbean for a th birthday celebration ticket bought in august and decided to spoil ourselves with a club class return having flown out premium economy arrived at airport to be told that we d been downgraded to premium economy due to overbooking apologetic ground staff defending the indefensible but no apology on the plane fuming all the way back to london exacerbated by hopeless cabin staff service tea when i asked for coffee and filthy food complained on return through ba exec club webiste with response from customer service day later ba claim that overbooking is a very rare occurrence and gave a lukewarm apology evidence from ground staff on both journey contradicts this and it seems to be a standard occurrence during peak season we booked early so probably had relatively cheap seat ba ha presumably made money by selling our ticket to a higher bidder general quality of ba service food and wine ha fallen dramatically over the last few year ba is now effectively a low cost airline flying a fleet of very tired aircraft trying to preserve the gloss of a quality airline the accountant may win in the short term but passenger will vote with their foot avoid this airline if you possible can and the final insult in booking premium seat with ba is that you get charge to pre reserve in club and in premium economy ba you are having a laugh with the flying public on this performance you don t deserve to stay in business,negative

chicago to london heathrow club class on british airway is without doubt the worst in the airline industry it is bad enough that ba persist using out of date airplane circa year old b s but they perpetuate the dreadful ying yang seating arrangement of club class where you have to look directly at the passenger next to you and raise a screen for privacy then mid flight the crew lower the screen to serve the food to leave the seat one ha to climb over the leg of a sleeping passenger no mean feat in the dark the crew from chicago were appalling and dumped the food upon u a quickly a possible breakfast wa inedible and i returned it uneaten the lounge at o hare wa a crowded tiny dirty facility with a food bar including some wilted vegetable and cracker with cheese insufficient chair and a single old tv doe no one at ba care how bad they have become for premium class passenger,negative

i booked a british airway flight from amsterdam to london heathrow in the beginning everything went normal and smooth check in and boarding wa easy and on time and once everyone boarded the problem started one after another first an announcement wa made by the pilot about a flight delay due to strong wind in heathrow fair enough afterwards the wind problem wa resolved but a passenger decided to leave so they had to take out his luggage after that we received a rd announcement stating there is a computer malfunction at schiphol airport and they are doing their best to resolve it this caused u already about min delay but me and other passenger still remained calm and relaxed and then the hell started we received permission to take off after min and then the pilot offered passenger who do not wish to travel to leave the plane of course there were many passenger who were travelling on business and i guess too delayed to make it on time for their meeting so they decided to leave the crew warned them that this might cause terrible delay and problem for the other passenger but they still decided to leave so a group of passenger left and we missed our opportunity to take off then the pilot announced that we can take off after or hour the flight wa full of overseas traveller we spent hour sitting in a plane which wa not moving anywhere people unboarded the plane time in total and no food or water wa offered to u we had to line up next to the bathroom to purchase food and drink and pay for it the overall experience wa terrible and it ruined the whole plan for my first day in london,negative

i understand completely why there is air rage in the sky when company such a boac go out of their way to make the travel experience an stressful and unpleasant a is humanly possible i paid to fly r t lax buh and yet they want an extra to have a desirable seat i understand if you check in hour before departure you receive a seat from those available but why is it they assign you the worst seat available when better are there in my case they assigned me a middle seat on a when both of the adjacent aisle seat are available to assign it is baffling the ground crew and the inflight staff are excellent but can do little with the oppressive business decision their executive make everything come down to make every penny they can and why am i flying boac they owed me from the last flight b c the inflight entertainment system wa inop for the cabin and so we all had to sit in the dark with nothing to do for a twelve hour flight on top of that their seat have so little padding and cushion that only the plumpest can sit in their seat longer that for normal sized adult it is a agonising a the rack must ve been and of course you only get compensation by patronising them again now i know ever a free ticket on boac is overpriced,positive

newark to bangalore return via london on ba premium economy world traveler plus i paid about more for premium economy about extra so approximately per leg wa it worth it i d say broadly yes though i wouldn t want to pay very much more than that and it would be harder to justify if only one leg of hour wa involved before boarding premium economy doe get a standard checked bag allowance whereas economy is bag though there are numerous exception where they allow and india to u canada is one of those exception though it isn t clear if it applies for travel originating at either end so i am not sure if i got an extra bag or not but i did use the bag allowance boarding you board in zone after first business the oneworld elite that is helpful a you do get dibs on the overhead storage if it doesn t fit in premium economy you can always put it in front or behind before economy begin boarding this mean you also get off fairly quickly which can help if you re in a hurry to get through security at heathrow for a connecting flight or through immigration at your final destination in flight there is a welcome drink for premium economy champagne juice water depending on the departure time there is also a hot towel service also cabin the ha a nicely done premium economy cabin seating a opposed to in economy so a somewhat wider seat seat pitch is also decent these are new style slimmer seat though possibly less cushioned than what you get on older seat but seat wa comfortable the food tray come out of the armrest and there is some seat back storage though not much there is a small drink tray built into the front of the arm rest which you share with your neighbor there is a recliner style footrest with support for the calf you do get a noise canceling headset which is nice and a basic amenity kit with eyeshade sock and toothpaste the seat back screen is large and easy to use there is no restroom in the cabin but one immediately behind in economy so not a long walk cabin ha a seating in premium economy same a club world a opposed to in economy the version used on the lhr blr sector ha a very small premium economy cabin just row of seat this give it a sort of cosy feel you do have to walk all the way through the economy section immediately behind you to get to the restroom economy looked pretty full on both the leg on the but premium economy wa not full and i had the seat next to me vacant on both leg that helped me stretch out for sure the seat back screen on the old is much smaller and the seat are older but possibly more cushioned than the slimmer seat food nothing much here i didn t think it wa all that different from what a regular economy meal would have been it wa ok nothing to write home about all in all for such a long journey the premium economy product did offer some additional comfort along with the early boarding and baggage worth it on extra long haul like u to india bit harder to justify on shorter flight or fewer leg,positive

san francisco to london heathrow on the lower deck of the a a very quiet smooth flight did not want to pay the usual ba extortionate seat pre reservation fee but still got seat together after the real scrum at the departure gate no apparent order struggle to get through to priority lane announcement completely inaudible etc we boarded to the reasonably comfortable if narrow seat of course the usual ba club class scramble over the leg to get to the aisle and abreast not really a premium product in today s competitive business class world welcomed with glass of champagne by attentive fa ok meal beef with decent wine to accompany much more up to date touch screen avod system but still a dreadful choice of blockbuster film very extensive choice for breakfast continental and cooked if you wanted it really very good fa s made you feel welcome landed on time but baggage for some reason took about hour to get to the belt a usual i have mixed feeling about ba if we are lucky enough to fly club business class it is comfortable but you do feel a bit let down by the appalling layout and huge charge to pre reserve seat if virgin atlantic fly the same route i will always choose their upper class a everyone ha aisle access and you don t have to pay to pre reserve your seat,positive

this wa a night flight new york jfk to london so it wa difficult to assess the service onboard although what i experienced wa certainly not bad i think this wa a very quiet flight judging from the number of people around the gate and there were only another pax in first but it s quite hard to tell when wrapped in the cocoon of the concorde room and first cabin the former felt very exclusive but a commented elsewhere to the point of being fussy it s irritating that they don t have any shower in the concorde room i wasn t amused to check in at the gallery business lounge be brusquely sent on to concorde only to have to return to galeries upon learning that that were no shower in the former it wa pm early august in nyc of course i needed a shower departure from ny were running around hour late that evening due to weather and we were warned about a min taxi to the runway but we were very well looked after at that point the cabin wasn t secured until just before takeoff and the boredom of the taxi wa eased by multiple and very welcome top ups of champagne seved by various member of the crew likewise all the perk of first class were there i wa addressed by name the crew introduced themselves individually dinner and drink order were taken etc all very courteous and professional after such a long delay i decided to have some more dinner a i wa quite peckish this came with some excellent wine and wa served promptly so there wa still plenty of time for sleep but the soup wa cold and the main wouldn t have been out of place in business class moreover it would have been nice if someone had mentioned that the ba arrival lounge at lhr would be closing by the time our delayed flight reached it destination had i known this i would have had breakfast and a freshen up on the plane a very annoying oversight that led to quite a lot of inconvenience picture a spoilt guy trying to insert contact lens in t arrival toilet perhaps you saw me the cabin layout and bed well it s easy to find detail of this elsewhere online but it s certainly nothing special for first class overall a very acceptable flight but i felt that the overly fussy service sometimes got in the way of the practicality of a short overnight atlantic crossing where can i have a shower in the morning where will i be having breakfast i ve had business class flight from other carrier that have absolutely nailed these aspect,positive
amman to london appalling service both on the flight and subsequent customer service we are strict vegan so pre booked vegan meal for our flight meal were delivered a usual and had the vegan slip on them but a i wa about to start eating i noticed that i had been given butter this made me doubt the authenticity of the meal when i called the staff over she had no idea what a vegan wa informing me that there wa no meat in it i had to explain to her what a vegan wa i e no dairy or egg it turn out that the so called vegan meal had milk and egg in it needless to say we did not eat our meal and they had no vegan meal shortly after they came around with the drink trolley so we asked for a coffee with soya milk the staff to whom i had had to explain what a vegan wa said oh i don t think we have that but we have semi skimmed milk i had to re explain to her that a vegan doe not have milk she said she would go and ask when she returned she said we don t provide that sort of thing that wa strange because week ago on the outbound journey you did so we had no meal no hot drink and our video screen did not work the customer service that followed from wa more appalling they could not care less it took age to get reply and when i did i wa just palmed off after several month of having to write email i wa informed that i had to submit everything by letter a they needed it on paper which wa just another way of getting rid of u so we did this after several more week they offered u the most pathetic compensation basically the value of the meal that we could not eat in voucher,negative
paphos to london gatwick in club europe we had checked before leaving our hotel and realised that the flight wa delayed a were many other flight due to bad weather the previous evening in uk we checked in on time only to be advised that there wa no lounge available for club europe passenger and if we wanted to use the premium lounge we could pay whilst we appreciate that there may not be a ba lounge it is normal that ba would have an arrangement with the local lounge provider a we have experience at many other airport when travelling in business class we were offered a voucher each due to the delayed flight paphos airport wa extremely crowded and having paid good money to travel in business class we were very disappointed with ba that no lounge access wa available the flight itself wa ok although two hour late the cabin crew provided good service and the meal service reasonable my wife chose the chilli con carne and i chose the roasted chicken both were a little dry on arrival at gatwick at we were through passport control quickly and then waited minute for the case to be delivered again very poor show ba ha some great asset particularly the cabin crew but we felt let down by the ground service at both end of this flight like u many traveller like to travel with a full service airline and in this case ba were lacking,positive
gatwick to paphos in club europe we travelled on the first saturday of the school holiday and whilst gatwick wa busy the check in for business class wa not to bad we expected the lounge to be busy but there wa plenty of free seat the flight boarded slightly late but we were not long in the take off queue we are used the ba s club europe offering and whilst would prefer a little more leg room the flight wa reasonably comfortable service from the cabin crew wa good it is nice that ba have gone away from the miniature bottle of wine in club europe and now serve by the glass the meal service wa quite good we both chose the chicken curry for the main course which wa tasty and not dried out flight arrived minute ahead of schedule very happy with the service,positive
new york to nairobi via london flight attendant were wonderful friendly cheery and helpful but the business class seat that face aft cause the passenger to have to crawl over the leg of a sleeping stranger even if you are seated next to a companion there is no easily accessible storage space by the seat even for a bottle of water the ife on the lhr nbo leg reminds me of the game pong in it resolution and food is mediocre at best ba charge to select business class seat for my family of it would have cost over to get assigned seat on the segment,positive
istanbul to london heathrow the plane itself wa old i found the food choice were a joke considering we have to pay for the privilege and we were not allowed to bring our laptop on the plane back had to be checked in for security purpose this meant that when i wa at ataturk airport we had no less than separate security check before check in one after check in and one before getting on the plane because we had no laptop there wa no entertainment on board and nothing to do for the hour on the plane norwegian offer free wifi so i could check my phone on the plane british airway need to improve their service level,positive

london to santiago de chile i wa flying premium economy with ba and surprised that i got a row seat on the left side for my own the seat wa spacious and even with an occupied neighbour seat i would have had enough space to feel very comfortable however lufthansa on the a also y give a bit more personal space at least it seems to me the seat recline wa good a well a the ife system big screen wide choice of program of which i chose to listen to some bbc concert the crew didn t impress me but wa very friendly and helpful the food wa extraordinarily good the chicken i had wa very delicious with sufficient food cheese salad dessert the frittata on breakfast wasn t good however i didn t like that they sealed the drink minute before the arrival a bit early i had a good experience with ba and would definitely fly again a all the thing seat ground service staff were like expected the dinner wa way above average premium economy is a good value for money especially on a hr flight,positive
flew a now ageing b flight ba to seattle pleasant flight with actually quite decent fillet steak for main meal ok choice of wine beer with meal and greeted with glass of prosecco when boarded comfortable seat but it s the old bug bear across with over the leg access to the aisle fortunately we were in the last row so my wife wa in the window seat with direct aisle access and we could look at each other and not at a total stranger i know ba are saying that they are introducing direct aisle access for everyone in club class but this can t come soon enough and abreast is not exactly a premium product in the present circumstance is it absolutely terrible in flight entertainment system although it wa on demand the aircraft wa fitted with a very ancient system blurry old screen awful audio take your own noise reducing headphone and a pretty dreadful choice of movie fa s great welcoming and gave good service but the main drawback with ba is their insistence that having paid for a premium service we then have to pay handsomely again to pre reserve our seat up to per seat per journey not what i expect from a flag carrier airline we refuse to pay this extortionate sum our choice have been noted on the loyalty card scheme and fortunately we have got seat together so far so although we had quite a pleasant flight to seattle with ba in club if virgin atlantic fly the same route we will choose their upper class over clubworld we can still reserve our seat for free with them,positive
flew london gatwick to tirana rinas bag drop at gatwick wa basically seamless and ba wa offering to check in your hand baggage for free the flight wa at and the gate wa supposed to be shown at am which wa oddly specific but a we got closer to that time that just got more and more delayed until we finally got our gate info at around for which boarding had already started boarding wa pretty much seamless the cabin crew greeted all the passenger which wa nice the legroom wa alright perfectly fine for a and and a half hour flight good recline aswell i don t understand why british airway opted for buy on board their free food offering before wa perfectly fine although the food offering wa just a few sandwich which were quite expensive and there wa no real hot food option just a few of their sandwich could be served hot flight were on time flight cost around return per person which wa quite pricey considering the cheapest option wa around half the price so overall it s a good option but if you can find something cheaper then go for it,positive

london to amsterdam ba s service ha gone notably downhill in the past couple of year but tonight s experience really take the biscuit i should now be in amsterdam however i am still writing this from london despite spending over hour on a plane to nowhere we boarded just about on time around only to be told that due to weather there would be a delay of an hour or so shortly after we were told that the route north of lhr were shut and no plane were taking off about an hour into the ordeal we were told that the airspace had reopened but there would be a minute wait for a slot one more hour in we were told airspace wa shut again after hour good news or so we thought we were to be on the move around minute or so later we did then leave the gate and we were given the safety briefing and taxied out to the runway we were then stopped halfway down the taxiway and told that am would be shut due to night flight restriction by the time we would have arrived so our flight wad cancelled we taxied back to the gate where we waited a further minute for ground staff to become available i must say during this and a quarter odd ordeal the pilot wa informative and tried to stay upbeat and the cabin crew were very good the crew gave u the in flight service minus alcohol so we were well fed and watered this is the full extent of my praise though little wa i to know that the real disaster wa still to come ba s ground handling wa attrocious we were told to head up to departure for hotel voucher and rebookings however ba had cancelled around flight and the queue were very lengthy voucher were being handed out to sleep on the floor of a hotel ballroom because all the room were full i have never heard anything like it this is beyond unbelievable no assistance for child elderly and no preferential treatment for connecting passenger or premium passenger a is the norm in this situation further the promised rebooking staff had all gone home i wa told to consult the ba app the following morning ba s app ha rebooked my flight two day later when my trip wa for three day total the feature on the app to select a different date for my flight so i can replan my trip for another weekend is broken i guess i ll be trying out their call centre in the morning this is all simply appalling we all understand that adverse weather happens but to keep u on a plane for hour when they knew before boarding that there would be delay is not on moreover ba surely know the opening hour of their destination airport why they could not have prioritised the am flight over flight to hour airport i do not know and a for the ground handling i have never had an experience this bad ba staff themselves were thin on the ground they left most of the work to heathrow staff who admittedly tried their best but hid behind the we don t work for ba excuse i ve had a cancelled flight before and yet still wrote the airline involved a glowing review because they genuinely couldn t have handled it better by contrast i don t see how ba could have handled this worse they really are indistinguishable from the budget airline these day save for the good lounge if you fly business,negative
aberdeen to abu dhabi via london despite being a gold member of the executive club i try to avoid british airway these day and now i ve reminded myself why flight crew don t afford old fashioned courtesy or service i m not saying they are rude just that they don t provide a decent level of customer service you get the basic and good luck if you want to grab their attention they walk up and down the aisle without making eye contact no bag at the other end on arrival which i guess you have to live with however the way they deal with it is appalling couldn t care less i feel hr delay on return flight seems ba is unsure if they want to be a budget airline or a true contender,positive
prague to denver via london i almost missed my flight because at check in i had to complete some really important paper that took minute later no one asked me for those paper flight to heathrow wa average what you expect from a hour flight at heathrow the security lasted me minute when i boarded the next the plane a lack of leg room it wa less than the flight before the flight then wa pretty much okay the food wa delicious had pasta with tomato sauce and several time drink the flight staff wa kind and helpful but the plane had no paid wi fi no outlet or usb port the screen were low quality,negative
seville to gatwick if it wasn t for avios and the fantastic deal that this can make flying ba if you collect them and use executive club for award ticket within europe i would never fly ba given the current product the cabin wa old cramped and dirty the cabin crew were abrupt and surly the buy on board is still a massive bug bear we were on award ticket but think it is unacceptable for food not to be complimentary,negative
london to amsterdam a delayed ba flight by min old airplane unhelpful staff delay seem so regular that staff have a casual attitude to delay another terrible show from british airway,negative
gatwick to barcelona check in efficient and friendly and helpful staff staff very welcoming in lounge and on board flight however the in flight product ha deteriorated salad ran out so no food option for business class passenger had to have sandwich seat dirty and no middle seat tray although business class no priority boarding for business passenger really disorganized at boarding calling people by group and line becoming mixed up on arrival no bag and trying to get update but no update trying to get update on baggage after hour but no update,negative
i thought it time ba deserved some compliment given so many negative comment that are common these day i wa fortunate to travel hong kong to london return in premium economy recently being able to check in at the downtown hong kong airport express station is a real bonus a is using the good qantas lounge at hong kong i found the on board service and operation a lot improved over the last time i flew long haul with ba the new group boarding sequence system mostly seems to work although a few of the sign are hidden or bent in the wrong direction so some people had no idea what wa going on but which helped me keep busy assisting people while waiting at the gate food and wine on board wa quite good and overall service excellent including recognising my one world status ba ha the best in flight magazine with article actually worth reading and also ha some very clever in flight program i also particularly welcomed the excellent service from goswami who found me a window seat for lhr hkg when returning and when using the first lounge at heathrow all in all made for an enjoyable experience a rarity these day,positive
faro to gatwick club check in wa fairly quick and the priority security worked well at faro ba now do have use of a rd party lounge here which sadly is absolutely awful it feel like an average office canteen with no comfortable chair and only just enough seat at all for everyone there it s really very tiny and is the only lounge for all the airline a well a lounge scheme like priority pas etc considering this is the only lounge in a massive brand new airport it s a pathetic offering food wa minimal and basic drink were pretty limited and they barely ever had any glass or plate available whilst ba do provide priority boarding they do not offer any form of priority to enter the gate and there is always a large queue for this once on board i have similar comment to my outbound flight in my opinion they should provide a better welcome a welcome drink and hand out menu prior to take off overall food and drink offering wa pretty good on this flight although cabin crew could have been a bit friendlier at one point i dropped one of my headphone and it bounced several row forward under someone else s seat i wa looking around for a while to find it and at no point did the crew offer to help at all instead just looking mildly annoyed that i wa temporarily blocking the aisle in order to retrieve it priority disembarkation and baggage at gatwick worked well and it meant we missed all queue at immigration and we landslide really quickly,positive
gatwick to faro club check in at gatwick is very quick and easy and fastrack security is also very efficient and we were quickly through to the club lounge the lounge itself is really nice spacious enough to have plenty of seating available and different type of seating but it also feel very cosy and welcoming the lounge wa clean and tidy and there were pretty good food option available including some lovely scone with clotted cream and jam a always the drink offering in ba lounge wa great the new boarding by group seems to be working quite well and ba staff are finally enforcing the priority system long may it continue on board wa the usual club europe offering which while not exactly luxury is standard for europe now and for a hour flight is fine ba don t ever seem to offer a welcome drink on short haul flight which wa a shame a there is plenty of time after the initial boarding rush is complete there wa also no personal welcome or greeting of any kind it s a quick and simple gesture that should be done on any decent carrier i would also like to see menu handed out before take off which could be done at the same time a a welcome the food and drink offering on board is reasonable although food wa typically over cooked and with sloppy presentation overall a decent enough flight and for a reasonable price but a few small touch would make it feel much better,positive
jeddah to chicago via london the flight from jeddah to heathrow wasn t a good a i expected ground staff at jeddah some of them were rude also the new baggage restriction for the flight to the uk made the trip uncomfortable i had to check my carry on bag at the gate because my laptop charger and the power bank were there they took my laptop when i dropped my bag and they told me there is no need to take the charger however the crew were nice and friendly and the food wa delicious too the flight from lhr to chicago wa full and the crew were helpful and generous i won t fly with ba again until they change their baggage restriction for the saudi flight,positive

gatwick to malaga when booking the ticket i realised that by choosing certain flight in club the fare wa cheaper than economy once i had added suitcase and pay for food onboard i hadn t flown ba club in europe for a while and wa looking forward to it i wa nicely impressed my outbound flight wa a wet lease by titan but this wa the full ba service the crew were very good a they were friendly and polite without being sugary sweet i wa very impressed by the quality and quantity of the food together with the selection of drink the only fault is that on both leg my suitcase did not come out a priority despite being tagged correctly,positive
bermuda to gatwick usual window and aisle seat taken crew friendly enough but when all meal option had cheese including sandwich not good when someone cannot eat cheese breakfast usual offering ok but not really worth the money paid seat clean and comfortable just feel it is time for ba to offer seat so people do not need to pole vault over other passenger s leg to get out from the window seat in the night,positive
aberdeen to boston via london heathrow i found the seat weren t wide enough and leg room wa restricted on the way back to london the person in front of me put the seat back a well and this severely decreased and room i had to move also the narrower seat meant that i really had to avoid taking up both arm rest otherwise they were good flight with slightly odd choice but decent food extensive entertainment option variety a well,positive

munich to london heathrow with british airway i booked my flight online about month ahead of my planned travel date and thought i would give this airline another try after a bad experience earlier in the year i give full mark to ba on this occasion in most area of service i arrived at the airport rather stressed a my mobile phone had been stolen in a salzburg coffee shop the check in agent wa very professional and reassuring towards me and entered into banter very willingly he wa professional and pleasant and very efficient too the flight wa on an a and boarding wa managed well and the staff well presented too the cabin crew were welcoming and orderly although there wa a delay it wa managed well and the cabin crew explained matter a the flight progressed i bought an overpriced tea and felt very comfortable arrival wa at a remote stand and then a bus overall a very good experience with ba,positive

london to madrid lazy seat allocation ha led to my husband and i not sitting together i understand i can pay to get a seat i want but other than having a seat next to my husband i don t want any particular seat we are travelling a a pair there are three seat each side of the aisle there will likely be single passenger travelling who have chosen a seat preventing u from sitting together a they don t know what group are travelling and do t care where they sit ba bothering to do the seat allocation for all the passenger you don t wish to pay for specific seat would avoid this,positive
luggage broken into no explanation first the good point cabin attendant were very diligent and friendly in business class on ba london to shanghai on june not so good the bizarre seating pattern that allows business class seat across the width of the plane feel cramped and crowded compared to a herringbone arrangement the trust breaker upon arrival in shanghai i wa not the only one from ba reporting missing luggage mine arrived day later and the zip locking mechanism had been forced open and damaged beyond repair or further use nothing wa missing so wa it subject to search a unaccompanied luggage people deserve an answer when luggage arrives in that state ba have not provided any explanation despite query to customer relation this is not acceptable corporate behaviour like this not only let down the customer but leaf an impression that betrays and outweighs the effort made by their own cabin staff,negative
london to tehran back in august the cabin looked so old and tired i struggle to understand why ba ha not updated yet on a lot of their b aircraft the inflight entertainment screen wa small with a resolution of something from the s but the selection of movie wa alright the meal service commenced and a half hour after taking off and considering this wa a night flight most of u were been starving at this point the option i wanted ran out by the time they got to me and i wasn t even sitting in the last row of the economy section the seat were very uncomfortable a couple hour later there wa another drink service,negative
pisa to london heathrow having booked and paid for extra leg room seat six month in advance we were unpleasantly surprised to find out that upon checking our booking on the ba website a couple of week before flying there had been a change of aircraft our new seat were shown a exit row seat and we therefore assumed that they would be extra leg room but upon boarding we realised that row of an a aircraft is standard seat pitch why didn t ba notify u of a seat change when they knew of this change week in advance of our flight once we d boarded we found that there wa one extra leg room seat still available which wa fortunate because my husband is tall and need that extra leg room the ba cabin crew did move my husband but said this happens all the time with row it might be an exit row but it s not extra leg room,positive
i recently took a first class flight from london heathrow to la vega and due to a plane change a number of people where upgraded the plane wa not ready for passenger and we boarded minute late when we boarded thing were still not ready and the staff were rushing around the service on the outbound flight wa fine but the plane wa old and dated the return flight wa a disaster the seat were dirty food wa like rubber plane wa dated seat smelt lauren perrier wa not served on takeoff for some reason some new policy apparently and again we had upgraded people in first which is not great when i complained i wa offered avios are you serious ba i think there are many other airline out there with a first class product which is much better than that i experienced on british airway unless a first class ticket on british airway is on sale i would suggest you fly with another airline british airway plane are dirty they have been told a number of time they are dirty it s about time they had a deep clean and re model the first class it s getting so old it s like club class with a few tweak,negative

the queue for bag drop wa massive and did not move for a good min a more senior person came and explained it wa due to software issue that there wa a delay in the bag drop excuse a i saw more staff came afterwards and the queue wa moving fine they could have just got more staff there to begin with group boarding wa super slow inside the econ cabin the plane seemed very old and worn out the entertainment system took a long time to reboot and they didn t inform the customer about it some of the flight attendant were unprofessional meal were bad for me the dinner wa some sort of curry chicken that did not taste good they gave energy bar for breakfast meal on a h min flight the wifi doesn t exist in the cabin,negative
british airway changed plane and consequently seating separating family in business class no co ordination at airport and apparently not one ba manager at rome airport who i could speak to had to call ba customer service in uk which wa a waste of time given bulkhead seat but upon boarding could not take seat a engineer trying to secure cabin divider in changed position failed to do this and left the plane with it unsecured a pilot did not want to miss take off slow advised stewardess but they did not care could not recline seat for fear of cabin divider falling and curtain wa in front of seat waste of time paying to go business class with ba they did make u wear a seat belt upon take off so if the bulk head fell we could not get out of the way,negative
mumbai to edinburgh via london i m quite surprised to read the varied review a i have always had a great experience with ba in term of in flight service and airport handling after sale service can be a different experience this flight i arrived a little late at the airport due to transport issue hot and sweaty and the check in girl wa such a blessing she calmed me down reassured me and helped me get through security swiftly i wa able to secure a very cheap last minute upgrade to premium economy and i am so glad i did the service wa wonderful we were looked after very well lot of water offered throughout the flight i thought the seat wa tremendously spacious and comfortable even for the regular upgrade price rather than seat to the side and rather than in the centre give you a lot more space the food wa ok i ve had worse i ve had better but i wa comfortable a good temperature and had a great choice of film my connecting plane wa late leaving heathrow to edinburgh due to bad weather but it wa handled very nicely all in all i m glad i flew ba for this trip,positive
mumbai to london heathrow disappointing experience i wouldn t book business class again felt like bad value for money i ve flown economy and premium economy before found economy basic and the seat uncomfortable but enjoyed premium economy for the quieter cabin and more space i expected a big step up in business class but really apart from choice of food better seat and a larger entertainment screen i really didn t see an upgrade in comparison to the huge extra cost the staff weren t that attentive so i felt like i got one much better meal with alcohol and then wa pretty much left alone until an hour before the end of the flight i had one person ask if i needed anything who then brought me the tea i requested the staff were helpful when i saw them but overall what a waste of money i paid an extra for better food on a tray with cutlery really not worth it,positive
delhi to london having read many negative review about british airway i boarded my flight fully expecting to have a bad experience but ended up feeling completely satisfied with all aspect of the flight it is all too easy to glamourise the old day but in it seeming decline british airway is no different to other european airline a a resident of the netherlands i hear dutch people saying exactly the same about klm their national airline and french friend say the same about air france the onboard service wa efficient and friendly if a little lacking in charm the food wa more than adequate the in flight entertainment wa adequate too i m not sure if the extra one pay for economy plus is really worth it in term of better food but if space and the quietness that come with a smaller cabin matter then it is worth it when we landed at heathrow a shortage of ground staff meant that we were stuck in the plane for minute before someone could be found to operate the bridge to let u off those people with connecting flight were naturally beginning to panic but the crew handled the situation admirably they more than rose to the occasion to provide the information and reassurance that passenger were seeking,positive
when you travel british airway it like you are lucky to be able to be with british airway staff right from the start the check in girl on business told u the flight wa closed which wa a load of rubbish hour and minute before the flight she spent ten minute on the phone to someone to see if it wa too late because i need special assistance they didn t have anyone to push my wheelchair so my wife had to do it my wife now very stressed and i arrive at the finger and when we could see that everyone wa still there i asked the man on the desk about being closed and he said nonsense my wife say thanks for the unnecessary stress the guy on the desk were great and offered to push my chair which wa actually quite a long way the cabin layout ha seat across whereas all the other s i have been on have that mean they are squeezing in another seat and it is very very narrow the cabin crew knocking my arm every time they passed by of course the is a great aircraft so for me the seat wa below my expectation i wa also amazed that i had to pay to reserve seat i don t pay anything with other airline the food wa just ok nothing exciting and the choice of film wa not that great but then that is all personal choice in my opinion fly with a different airline if you can there are seriously better airline who don t have snob working for them,positive
british airway get plenty of well deserved kicking but this return flight to gibraltar wa faultless on time early arrival in fact smiling friendly crew excellent hot meal and plentiful drink gatwick lounge is too small really but we found seat ok gibraltar lounge for the dozen or so club passenger is relatively huge,positive
ba first class is not even that any more starting with the lounge in t this may be an offshoot of the fine concorde room in t but it need not feel like a rural train station poor food average drink and an indifferent staff do not compare with lh facility in fra or muc there is no ground assistance and boarding wa haphazard fine cornish champagne wa offered and happily quaffed the seat wa ok but not in the same class a the new ac j class pod and not close to the emirate s suite small thing like the menu presentation boarding sufficient food there are a lot of seat in f seat comfort ok but nothing special and the toilet small and curiously offering single ply paper the crew were very friendly the service wa decent in delivery but poor overall ba your relentless drive to the bottom is catching up with you and your first class product is not worth the name anymore one can only assume that ba are trying to phase it out a they drive any paying passenger to other airline who place a serious effort to deliver a superb premium product and no wi fi,positive
linate to london the morning of the departure i received an email and a text message from that warned me that my flight had been canceled with no specified reason a an alternative they rerouted me on a night flight to madrid then to palma to arrive the next day in birmingham disappointed of the disservice i called the customer service in england and waited minute at my expense before being able to speak with an operator and i wa offered a flight in the evening at which did not help me to arrive in time to my appointment and therefore declined i had to find the only possible flight that would allow me to get to london in time unfortunately it wa a last minute flight with another company that cost me a fortune on top of it since the flight would arrive no longer at heathrow but at stansted i had to pay the taxi more than the agreed amount if i arrived at heathrow british airway did not take responsibility i wa not reimbursed the new flight i had to book last minute nor the taxi difference they did not show concern for the inconvenience and the stress caused the worst ha been the answer of their customer care saying it wa not their responsibility,negative

we can not fault the new club world food and service on the outbound and inbound it wa great the food wa first class the presentation very attractive the quality very high haven t had such tender beef on any airline before or in a restaurant for that matter lately and the new style crockery glass wear stylishly upmarket it s world away from what it used to be both crew were attentive friendly and cheerful really liked the way the food came out on a trolley and you could pick and choose what you liked and mix and match if you wanted to you now get a light day blanket a padded blanket for night and a mattress protector type thing to put on the base of your seat much better than the thin always static blanket you used to get the pillow is larger and ton better than before can t believe how fast the time flew and how well we felt on landing both in seattle and once home again we do mainly club europe flight shame a if this level of service and food is maintained the new club world will be a great success,positive

flew on a last minute emergency trip london heathrow to baltimore with ba most disappointing feature on this roundtrip wa the aircraft the new boeing i found the aircraft too small and cramped for transatlantic route in it seating configuration despite the crew in flight service and the inflight entertainment being of a generally average economy standard the aircraft lacked the legroom and seating comfort of the other aircraft i have flown on other transatlantic route a and ba need to remove many seat from this aircraft in economy class also the cabin air temperature wa awful and humid with no individual regulation this felt to me more like being crammed in to a boeing on a transatlantic flight,negative
earlier this year my wife and i travelled business class with ba from dublin to jo burg returning from cape town thru london in each direction having paid business class fare we were then quite taken aback to have to pay an additional for seat selection on the long haul sector had we not selected seat we could have found ourselves not just separated but possibly with one of u on the upper deck and one on the lower deck of the a on the way out and the on the return flight we therefore had no choice what sort of customer retention policy is this no other airline with whom we have travelled business class ha then charged for seat selection but ba just don t seem to care it is a rip off the forward rear facing business class seat plan on ba plane is really unattractive complicated further by having to climb over a sleeping passenger to reach the aisle from a window seat ba should take a look at the emirate a if they want to see a customer friendly layout this wa our first business class experience with ba having flown with middle eastern airline particularly we have discovered how much behind the play ba actually are,positive

the overall flight wasn t too bad seat and everything wa comfy enough although my girlfriend television didn t work for either the outbound or inbound flight and little effort wa made for a resolution i understand that it isn t the flight attendant fault but it would have been nice if a little more effort than there s nothing we can do wa given to the issue on the flight from gatwick to tampa we were stuck on the aircaft for approximately minute a the bridge wasn t where it should be which once again wasn t the worst problem in the world but after a long flight isn t particularly what you wanted it wasn t the best experience,negative
ba s gallery lounge at cpt is adequate but let down by a poor food selection including packaged cheese and biscuit with flimsy wooden knife and limited wine choice champagne wa conspicuously lacking toilet paper wasn t being refreshed in the toilet and here wa no lock on one of the cubicle door there were no information screen so one had to wait for the tannoy call to board boarding itself wa efficient with priority for group and seat j k on the upper deck are the best of a mediocre job and at least there s plenty of storage space in the window bin take off wa on schedule fa went through the motion with little enthusiasm the food wa the worst we ve ever experienced in club world the smoked chicken salad wa atrocious and the scrambled egg with chive in a tortilla wrap deserves to be in a museum of culinary horror the white company bedding wa a let down and far removed from the luxury portrayed in advert there s little one can do to remedy a hard seat landing wa ahead of schedule overall a lacklustre flight in an ancient plane with a sub par business class product british airway are falling ever behind their competitor,negative
gatwick to san jose i ve just stepped onto a ba flight from gatwick to costa rica an hr flight and can honestly i haven t seen a screen with so few pixel since the s i fly other long haul flight and none of ba s competitor are providing such low quality entertainment i used to think of british airway a being a premium airline now they re just rubbish,positive
i took the new option of the new toronto to london gatwick which debuted this summer a a seasonal route cheaper than the heathrow service it wa an interesting experiment in whether i could fall back in love with gatwick excellent check in at pearson a usual but spoiled by the third party lounge goodness know what ba were thinking given the old lounge wa well run with excellent drink and food option the premium plaza lounge is cheap and nasty on time boarding on a near empty flight too early in the season for the return traffic to have built up the cabin wa a third full juice and water offered no prosecco in premium economy though the crew member couldn t explain why it s not offered to london but why champagne in biz is manageable on time departure and a fast drink service this is my first experience of gatwick crew fast sociable less formal and street ahead of mixed fleet crew serving heathrow and all over the meal wa vile overcooked salty and dry a the plane wa empty i went back to economy and had three hour sleep across three seat awful breakfast of pretzel roll and cream cheese wa served before landing ife on both leg wa dated and still the same selection since my flight at christmas an early arrival and fast bag finished off a ok flight returning i liked the biz first class check in area at lgw fast and friendly the lounge at gatwick wa street ahead of heathrow self serve champagne and load of seat kept very clean and plenty of food an upgrade to biz wa nice on a full flight efficient boarding and a fast coat drink and menu service a really fast bar service only min in with well cooked food made the service just like the old day of long haul cabin crew from heathrow the only thing that spoilt it wa off duty ba staff in biz chatting and distracting the crew on duty while drinking in the aisle and generally being loud and annoying an early arrival into toronto finished a near perfect flight the gatwick s are old very old with no power in premium economy currently going through a refurb progamme but with efficient and friendly crew and on time early performance there wa little to dislike and i even liked gatwick,positive
first time flying with british airway in economy on a transatlantic flight from london to chicago i wa impressed by the hard work of the professional and friendly flight attendant they walked up and down the plane helping people with various issue and offering good tasty meal snack and drink of all kind i will definitely fly british overseas again given a chance the economy seat on this old but well kept boeing were very comfortable and i am a x lb and still did not feel cramped i would encourage all my friend to fly british if they want to have a very comfortable flight from the u to europe thank you british airway very good service indeed,positive
geneva to vancouver via london worst experience terrible service and when we wrote with constructive criticism they offered voucher and no apology an insult a did not ask for compensation it s an expensive price to pay for a low cost airline on a positive point the geneva to london flight were fine but the long haul flight to vancouver were abysmal,negative
this is the first time i have flown ba s club europe flying from london heathrow to corfu i wa not expecting a great deal having read a lot of less than positive review online however i wa very pleasantly surprised shortly after boarding we were offered a welcome drink with a bag of nut and a choice of magazine to read not long after this there wa a full drink service followed but a course meal which wa very tasty i had cured salon followed by chicken breast then ginger cheesecake and a small cheese plate we were then offered a choice of hot drink and a top up of champagne the crew were very attentive and helpful they had a smile on their face all the time and the flight seemed to zip past the seat were the usual economy seat with the middle blanked by a tray but for a relatively short trip it wa fine this flight wa an upgrade using avios and i would happily do it again i paid around avios and an extra in tax which i think wa very good value for what i had,positive
our original flight wa cancelled a my wife and i were just disembarking from a cruise ship we were then advised shortly after by sm that we had been automatically re booked on a flight the next day to london heathrow this wa not a lot of good when our car wa parked at gatwick i managed to get through to ba and wa given a new booking to gatwick also the following day we were offered no other assistance by the airline the following day we turned up at the airport to find the new flight wa running minute late having eventually boarded the aircraft we stayed at the gate for about minute before the captain deigned to tell u that the delay wa being caused by problem at barcelona airport shortly thereafter the captain advised u that we might wait for another two hour so we would be given water this wa quickly superseded by a further announcement that a slot had become available at short notice so no water wa served the real horror of this flight however wa british airway new food service whereby passenger buy food and pay by card avios this simply doe not work after one hour in the air the trolley had moved about nine row from the front of the cabin eventually a flight attendant attempted to work from the back forward by running backwards and forward from the trolley about minute from touchdown he reached u and we asked for two can of drink and a packet of crisp potato chip he returned to tell u he had no crisp and only one can which we duly shared between u having been on the aircraft for three and a half hour this wa the only refreshment we could obtain i consider this to be completely unacceptable if this is the level of service we can now expect from british airway there is no point traveling with them the budget airline can do better at lower cost,negative
hong kong to london this wa my first business class trip on ba a i mostly use emirate or cathay pacific in comparison ba offer a very low standard the flight attendant who served the section where i wa seated couldn t have cared less no greeting when passenger boarded the plane no offer of help he asked for my drink order but never delivered the drink no second drink wa offered the toilet hadn t been cleaned properly before boarding and during the flight one of the two washroom became unusable resulting in long queue the seating arrangement having to face a stranger who sits in the opposite direction is uncomfortable overall appalling quality and little value for money,negative
washington to bucharest return via london i wa originally booked in world traveller plus but at dulles check in wa offered a club world upgrade at just more which i accepted resulting flight wa very comfortable with good food and top drawer service the two london bucharest sector both went well but all this wa just a prelude to my return trip while in bucharest i sustained a fall and although i wasn t seriously hurt it wa still difficult to walk long distance especially with heavy luggage at the bucharest airport bag drop the agent noticed my situation and offered assistance which i accepted and wa promptly wheeled through security passport control and the very long corridor to the gate then put aboard the plane on arrival in london i wa met by more assistance to whisk me through the vastness of t and onto the plane this time with the pleasant surprise of another club world upgrade this time for free once on the plane back to washington the cabin crew couldn t do enough for me checking how i wa doing going through meal choice the menu this time round wa a bit heavy on cheese and other dairy item i really can t eat but ultimately i still ate well getting me drink and more they were a professional and proactive a crew a i ve ever experienced in year of long haul travel finally once arrived at dulles more assistance wa waiting right up to getting my cab what could have been an ordeal on this return trip wa turned into a relaxing and satisfying a travel experience a can be imagined through the year i ve had mostly excellent experience with ba cabin crew and that s a big reason why i ve stayed with ba all these year and will continue to do so but a big standing ovation for the cabin and ground crew for these flight for above and beyond service you re the best,positive
london to warsaw ba european service is becoming like an expensive low cost airline the price of seat selection still remains high the seat on the outbound flight is not even reclining and it wa a hour flight you can always feel the elbow of the passenger next to you whenever someone is moving i didn t buy any food or drink onboard although i reckon it s not badly priced the inbound flight wa on an older a in which the seat wa reclining,positive
london to istanbul due to poor weather condition at lhr the flight wa initially delayed by hour which is quite understandable when the passenger were informed of the gate everyone gathered at the a gate in t then no announcement and the ground staff were in a world of their own next there is a screen notice that the flight will depart from a c gate everyone rush to the one of the last of the c gate once on board the dreaded announcement that the flight will be delayed by another hour the flight finally take off nearly three hour late after a while the crew come with the m s gibberish but passenger are so hungry that by the time the crew serve the fifth row in economy the sandwich are all over and i had packet of crisp and a diet coke for dinner the flight arrived in istanbul three hour late and to add insult to injury the aircraft stop at a remote gate and we have to trek to the terminal,negative
london to cape town flying first class with british airway is a hit or miss affair but having secured a couple of return flight to cape town with avios our expectation were running high a we entrusted our car to the meet and greet parking unfortunately terminal isn t the best starting point and gallery first lack glamour or decent champagne the food on offer is adequate although hardly first class hoping for better on board we didn t use the sit down menu boarding wa on time and according to ba s new group allocation our seat k and k were a first for u a we ve previously gone for pair in the centre but seat a and k are definitely superior with more storage space and better privacy however there s no escaping the fact that the relatively recent first class refit is in a relatively ancient plane particularly when one inspects the shabby state of fitting in the toilet and galley the ife is also showing it age and badly in need of an upgrade but at least it didn t require rebooting on our flight cabin crew in first were the usual mixed bag the fa looking after our side seemed to be in the wrong job food wa better than usual although a malfunctioning oven meant that we had to wait minute for our hot breakfast landing wa ahead of schedule and we were through immigration and baggage reclaim within minute overall a decent flight but let down by the attitude of the cabin crew and the age of the plane,positive
london to hamburg typically if i fly ba it is sfo or lax to lhr this time i flew them from miami via tampa thru lhr to hamburg using their avios point i secured a first class seat which of course is a scam because ba charge you fee and surcharge to use those point at per direction their miami operation appears to be a poor second class cousin to american a they use two of their ticketing and check in kiosk plus share the american premium class not lounge all the american processed slice of cheese and bologna you can eat with free booze is not what i call a premium lounge the ba gate in the dreadful e terminal is not even on the main floor but downstairs people jammed up to the entry point for boarding which creates a mess of boarding people by section boarding wa like a cattle call ba fly one of it oldest b into miami and it showed even in first the seat were of the older design and it appeared the carpet wa recent but the cabin smelled of moldy carpet the service and food wa surprisingly good compared to their service out of california the flight wa late leaving and late arriving and this miami flight doe not dock in terminal rather terminal and requiring it passenger to take shuttle bus to the other terminal which is what i did for my connection to hamburg in the end i decided i wa done with ba because their service model for premium passenger ha hit rock bottom their avios program is nearly worthless on any premium class booking or on it partner airline try using ba point on american or cathay or even alaska and you will find it impossible regardless how far in advance you try,positive
turin to london gatwick rubbish check in service a bad a ryanair i show the staff my mobile boarding pas checked website that i have x kg bag checked allowance one bag wa over kg they refused to honour the kg allowance and told me i will risk myself to miss the flight and not able to check in they were so rude and unhelpful boarding wa with the same unhelpful and unprofessional staff with the very arrogant manner flight wa delayed without the checked in agent saying anything after all passenger board they start to tell people there will be an hour or so delay due to weather at the very least the young crew serve passenger complimentary juice or water during the wait,negative

los angeles to london heathrow desperately poor service from british airway in club class business class is utterly outdated with the weird facing each other configuration and narrow uncomfortable seat the food served wa appalling the cabin crew were inattentive at best and appeared disinterested in providing genuine customer service the problem with british airway now in first and business class is what they are completely lacking namely any class or manner whatsoever poor food uncomfortable seat terrible small movie screen no wifi and an overall budget airline experience british airway even charge for seat selection too which add insult to injury avoid this horrible airline if you can the only redeeming feature of this airline is the wonderful quiet airbus a a shame ba ruin the aircraft with such a poor quality product and attitude,negative

outbound from lhr to washington on a refurbished wa in economy all in all wasn t a bad experience modern looking cabin with excellent ife system food and wine wa good and cabin crew very attentive wa looking forward to the return trip a had upgraded to premium economy return flight ba wa delayed by late arrival of inbound flight but no worry could relax in the pe cabin boarding the aircraft and turning left for the first time ever immediate disappointed how old wa the plane the cabin wa dull and those seat looked a though they had seen better day a quick check and this particular wa delivered to and hadn t had the refurbishment treatment leg room wa a tad better than economy but seat control not very efficient and a for the ife system that decided not to work mind you the screen wa so small and scratched i doubt i would have been able to watch anything cabin crew offered a pre take off drink water or orange juice and a hot towel that had seen better day it wa the sort of thing that you clean your car with after a few word from the captain we departed the evening meal wa some sort of chicken with rice with real cutlery and wa ok wine and g t wa acceptable about hour before landing breakfast wa served or should i say offered some sort of filled roll i declined and had a tea in a paper cup and nothing more offered i should add that the cabin crew were very attentive and tried to make u feel a bit special for having spent an extra for the upgrade ba this experience wa a disgrace for a once proud airline never again,positive
singapore to london this wa the second part of my sydney to london trip and looked forward to it a it wa on a ba a now this aircraft in qantas colour is one i am very familiar with having flown around sector over the last month with qf a mentioned in my review of ba which wa the first leg of this trip it is the on board soft product that is the problem the same comment for that review apply here the ife is a work of mystery in term of content on qantas american cathay one get a really good mix of old and new movie great music choice those who compile the content need to look at what they mean by award winning godfather gladiator brave heart roman holiday etc are all thing we a passenger want to see some smart edgy team in soho london pulled the content together forgetting that not everyone is edgy and want to see cutting edge stuff ife is one thing on long haul the other is food and beverage the food quality wa just substandard and something i read about constantly on qantas say qf from singapore to london one get the evening meal service followed by weiss ice cream a lindt chocolate along the way midnight snack of a pizza or sandwich and morning breakfast fruit or egg with usual muffin etc at the rear of the main deck is a snack bar and in the galley will be found chocolate banana bread cheese and biscuit you would need to be really hungry to get through that lot but the point is that it is available and offered ba need to get away from a meal service on take off and landing and nothing in between the a is a flagship aircraft and on qantas it is treated a such i am a qantas fanboy and spend a lot of time on their plane put the smartest best looking crew onto a flagship a that is what people will remember the ba crew were of a certain vintage more suited to lawn bowl one guy looked like steptoe for those who remember and wa a miserable flying on an a should be an experience and i enjoy all my trip on that aircraft ba have managed to reduce it to a very large low cost aircraft moving people from one point to another that is sad given the stature of ba i came back on ba from london to hong kong and the same comment apply hard product is fine except for no snack bar but the soft product is lacking severely,positive
sydney to london via singapore it ha been a very long time since i wa on a long haul with ba of more than hour last year had a relative sprint from london to jfk and before that in the year have not been kind to ba probably a mixture of the decline of ba and the emergence of other airline nearly all my long haul is with qantas on it a occasionally emirate on it version and then once in a while with cathay pacific and american airline the problem is not the hard product a b or the a in whatever colour and decor is ordered is the same air frame the b from sydney to singapore wa fine nosier than the a but that is well known very comfortable seat and at hour a relative sprint for those who call sydney home it is the soft product that is lacking check in wa fine and despite being in economy had an express pas through security being a gold ff with qantas boarding wa orderly and an on time departure and arrival into singapore now it just a lack of polish with the soft product no menu given showing what wa to be served a with cathay emirate and qantas the cutlery wa really cheap and i mean cheap kfc offer a better grade of plastic i know in these day of security that proper silverware is not possible but someone at ba need to check out the plastic used on cathay and qantas the food itself wa very bland a salad that had seen better day and penne with some sauce that wa over salty qantas have done away with salad and simply give you a main dish plus garlic bread and a dessert it s just the quality that is lacking drink i have a tradition something silly about starting a journey off with a jack daniel and coke this is available on qantas but no sir we don t serve that a note about the fa s they were great but one get the feeling that they are chirpy to mask some of the shortcoming with the product they are asked to deliver final word about this leg is the ife a touchscreen but it wa slow in response time and the selection wa diabolically bad award winning or classic film with not a noted film from the last year one or two interesting thing and some new release come on ba for may being on a plane for that length of time is a perfect opportunity to catch up on much loved classic a for music well i m but still like the pearl jam etc of the world we are not all into brit pop and edgy music presenter if ba is serious about the airline business then it need to sharpen up the soft skill the food and beverage and add a touch of pizzazz about the airline it is a mix of ba going back and many others coming up and beyond the standard that ba set many year ago,positive

miami to london my most recent ba experience wa positive i fly ba for work and leisure up to long haul flight a year on my most recent flight from miami to lhr i found the whole economy experience well above average despite the dated aircraft the which to me is the legend of the sky the cabin crew in economy were smart attentive and seemed to go beyond the call of duty giving an elite service from the mia ground handling american crew food and beverage service wa good seating in my aisle seat e generous for my long leg i recently flew ba business club world to the far east for work and despite the unlimited catering and frill the cabin staff lacked the attention and friendliness of this flight well done ba you excel against the north american carrier on route to the north american gateway who give just a basic service,positive

ba used to be a byword for quality and service you simply can t say that anymore and the only thing that seems to have stayed the same is the ticket price i paid dollar for my ticket from istanbul to london with ba for that price there is no airbridge you will wait on a crowded bus and no entertainment note this is a hour flight also screen device larger than a phone are banned from this flight so no alternative of watching movie on your ipad oh and you ll have to buy any food and drink on board i flew ba on this route because no other flight time worked for me however turkish airline is by far the better option with airbridge free hot meal and a modern entertainment system pegasus and atlasglobal offer a similar service to ba but at far lower price it seems to be the same all over ba used to be a first choice but at this price for this service it s become a last resort,negative

flew british airway from rotterdam to london city our trip started with a delay due to a technical problem but we were promptly rebooked on the next flight which took off a little over an hour later so that wa not a big problem nice aircraft with good legroom and a friendly crew providing a drink and a snack on this min flight inbound flight had a delay of min again because an other plane had a technical problem so on that point ba need to improve also check in via ba app didn t work both way so again there s room for improvement would still recommend especially on this route because of the short check in time and short walkway at rotterdam and london city price can be high though especially when you have checked luggage but we hadn t and i booked well in advance paid euro rtn for two which wa fine the advantage of london city is apart from the distance to london that you do not have to pay for an expensive train ride,positive

the first class cabin are in need of refurbishment but since this aircraft type is ageing this might been a pointless wish the seat were very comfortable and completely functional entertainment choice were current varied and easy to access although the earphone supplied were not of the noise cancelling variety the cabin staff wa remarkably efficient and very kind the food for dinner while not overgenerous in choice wa delicious and well presented with the option of dining at your own convenience the breakfast menu wa surprising in the variety of choice offered overall an extremely pleasant experience there is no wi fi available on this aircraft type,positive
toronto to london return business to london and first back to toronto all on avios fast check in at pearson with the usual friendly check in team fast track wa quick and in the new rd party lounge within min ba presumably to save money have shut their lounge and gone to a rd party provider premium plaza it frankly awful no class or professionalism with limited wine and spirit option and cheap and nasty food piled high elevator music drove u mad and we were pleased to leave the lounge prematurely to board the aircraft what on earth are you thinking ba fast boarding though with fewer crew the boarding service in club is fragmented late with champagne wash bag after take off etc with only four crew working club there just isn t time to offer a quality pre flight experience the new tray service for drink is more professional but took age we were served drink minute into the flight and a we were near the back of the cabin had our meal min after being served drink all choice were available but the food is just not club standard poor entree cheap salad and reminiscent of economy food of year ago ba really need to roll out the new meal service quickly how long doe the new pilot service to new york have to last for got some sleep had an okay fast breakfast passed on the vile looking egg and bacon muffin with an early arrival and bag topping off a better than expected flight returning on first wa one of my better experience via the new first check in fast track and concorde lounge excellent service on boarding a fast drink service after take off and some really well cooked food all choice available some decent sleep wa followed by a really average afternoon tea dry sandwich with mean filling but okay cake and scone early arrival at the gate wa spoilt by very slow bag min after landing these were my first mixed fleet biz and first class service experience the crew were young and lacking experience knowledge but make an enthusiastic polite and smart however they were clearly following the book to the letter which lead to slower and wooden service long haul crew were cranky at time but they would connect better and offer a more sleek fast service which is what is needed on east coast flight flower have returned to the first class bathroom and the slide in quality and cut in service seemed to have stopped but ba really need to roll out the promised change faster to retain premium customer,positive
la vega to manchester via london fairly dire a always ba is cutting the new club world product a i speak before even having rolled it out addicted to cut perfect partner for aa so i get on board and am told i now need to purchase food and beverage on the domestic leg so why did i not fly a low cost airline there no difference whatsoever the crew seemed fresh out of school and so inexperienced and what do you get for food on a transatlantic hour flight to vega a starter of lettuce and carrot and two unripe cherry tomato no oil just some grey vinegar it wa foul i assume nobody ate it the main wa tomato pasta or curry the curry wa so appalling i ate none of it the chicken wa like paste the sauce dried out and the rice overcooked i cannot bear fruit so the only normal looking thing a mini blueberry muffin wa given to my ravenous neighbour no cheese cracker these day nothing served with cold tea i really loved also being rammed on a transfer bus from t to lhr t having waited minute to get on bus sweating like crazy the driver just kept shouting to move down the bus it won t leave until it is full then the bus onto the back of the plane even though the bridge is on and to top it all of ba now offer a free copy of the sun instead of the mail or express i have another flight in may which is non refundable i am desperately hoping they move my flight so i can cancel they usually do this or time a booking so feeling good this is not a full service airline it is fully no frill the only exception is i think is the long haul canteen meal you get the airline is a national embarrassment the flight attendant try and have to cope with what they have been given but the ground staff are beyond it fly this budget airline at your own peril think about spending a bit more i m going to try lufthansa or thomas cook though i admit i m dreading that prospect,negative

amsterdam to london service ryanair wouldn t tolerate but with premium price every two year or so i fly with ba and every two year i am reminded just why i don t normally fly with them whilst not a bad a my previous experience which chopped about hour off a day break to milan and left me out of pocket a all public transport had stopped by the time we arrived an no they wouldn t refund me we were still delayed all the other airline had their delay on the board so their customer could do other thing ba didn t show the delay until we should have been boarding get to the gate with my shopping what else are you to do during a delay and am told that it must fit in my suitcase or they ll put one of my bag in the hold even ryanair allows a bag of duty free on it would obviously have fit under the seat next to my purse but no that wasn t allowed once we were on board the reason became clear just like easyjet ryanair and many of the other budget airline ba doesn t include a checked bag meaning that all the hand luggage won t fit in the cabin ergo their staff find silly reason to confiscate your bag so not only wa the flight delayed but i now had to wait for a suitcase once we arrived at gatwick everything went smoothly i managed to catch the last train to my destination unlike the previous time i d flown with them additionally the staff were very rude and condescending towards passenger do not fly ba save your money and go with a budget airline the colour may be gaudier but the service is the same and the staff are infinitely friendlier,positive

i flew premium economy from london to cape town on british airway having flown premium economy before i had certain expectation of what i would be getting but i wa sorely disappointed this wa by far the most expensive premium economy i have ever flown and unfortunately also by far the worst the plane wa old and tired and clearly in need of some refurbishment from premium economy i expected wider seat and more legroom the seat were cramped and the remote for the entertainment system wa located in the side of the seat where i wa constantly pushing against it i finally gave up and hung the remote control over the side of the seat the personal entertainment system with noise reducing headphone the screen wa tiny the blind next to me could not be pulled down the headphone were plugged into the side of the seat where i kept knocking them but the quality wa inferior to the point that i spent the flight having to hold the headphone plugged in so that i could actually hear anything expected to board ahead of economy passenger with priority boarding no priority boarding at all i find it shocking that ba charge exorbitant price to fly plane that quite clearly are on their last leg i needed to change my return flight after having tried several time with no success i phoned ba and wa on hold for about minute after which i gave up and just cancelled the flight which worked first time i booked a flight on another airline and for just more i got a seat in business class that wa absolutely brilliant,negative

dublin to heathrow ba get worse and worse and worse today wa special though a usual the did the standard in dublin by calling the flight a boarding in the lounge when it clearly wasn t after a five minute walk from the lounge it still hadn t started again a usual club food is the choice between a petrol station quality panini and a minute salad today a a special treat they hadn t heated the panini for my row so cold they really showed the nasty cheap ingredient and finally they ran out of champagne about the only advantage left of club,negative
london to new york aircraft wa very dated ife poor meal service average no snack poor drink service crew exceedingly unfriendly and customer service after the flight abysmal seat on these aircraft which have not been refreshed are beyond threadbare and we re outdated a decade ago the meal service ha taken a severe cut in recent year to top everything off the crew couldn t even provide a sincere smile or feign the slightest interest embarrassing when you tell ba about a negative experience they ll waffle on about how great they are but fail to resolve the complaint absolute waste of time don t waste your money flying ba i ve had far more positive experience on ryanair,negative

london to houston executive gold club refused to help me or keep u informed about the case that did not get put on to the flight they subsequently missed another two day of flight at possible flight per day the staff were steadfastly of the opinion that this is not problem because we have received a card with usd to buy essential item and that is sufficient in their eye furthermore they were more interested in leaving to go home and had ticked all the box at their end needless to say that because we are away for christmas new year we cannot wear the basic for dinner another fact that really made no impact nor wa it of any consequence to gold club team i repeatedly explained that we could not attend dinner without the proper attire which is currently residing in the case that ba and baggage handler have deemed less than priority because we have been given usd no phone call can be made to update u and the website advises that they are currently looking for the luggage which would be the same case that wa dismissed from being loaded onto today s flight furthermore the suitcase could go on a minimum of flight per day including the actual day it wa not sent a there wa a later flight which would have reunited the bag with the owner negated the requirement of giving u usd in the first place the callous disregard and blatant contempt displayed throughout this ordeal ha ruined our holiday to the extent that we have requested ba return u home where we can collect the suitcase ourselves the tag that may have fallen off is of no concern a everyone is well aware the shell of the case ha the bar code sticker on it for that exact reason so that you can track the item,negative

london to rome it s been a while since i last flew on ba and it certainly ha changed while the terminal staff aircraft and seat are of the same high standard a before the free in flight meal and beverage have disappeared and must now be purchased it seems that ba is slowly morphing into a low cost carrier at least a far a european destination are concerned presumably this is due to the competition from easyjet and ryanair a well a it s ceo hailing from vueling i suppose it s only fair given that the fare wa a cheap a the other two and ba fly out of lhr,positive

seattle to london good experience all round and nothing much to complain about fa s efficient and friendly flight wa on time meal quality wa average overall believe the extra amount for premium economy worthwhile although i had cashed in some mile to cover the upgrade so perhaps a false economy major complaint is ba s policy of charging to book a seat it s extremely irritating and stressful especially in premium economy upwards,positive

vancouver to edinburgh via london wa the worst travel experience i have had i wa travelling with senior we requested assistance and nobody showed up at any of the gate neither departing nor arriving we actually had to beg for help the distance between gate is far and too much walking for senior in our way from london to edinburgh it wa a nightmare the flight wa delayed and we got to london about an hour late on top of that we asked for assistance to take the senior to the next gate and no one seemed to care the senior had to walk all that way it wa not only the walking it wa the rush they had a we had to go trough immigration and the next flight wa living in less than hour on our way back from inverness to canada another nightmare despite we requested assistance in advance once again there wa nobody waiting for the senior at the gate again we had to beg for assistance and the british airway staff did not seem to know or care about this they said that they called the buggy and that wa all we said that we were going to miss the airplane a the gate terminal distance were far and no one seemed to care at all we were lucky i asked a gentleman who wa driving one of the buggy and passed by and he kindly accept to take the senior to take the bus area from terminal to in london and then arranged for them to be picked up in terminal and after security point this gentleman who is not british airway employee provided a great service summarizing the only good experience we had wa with an external person that just by chance i asked and he decided to help u out seat were another problem we did the online check in before and we had the seat already chosen d for one senior isle and d isle for the other senior when we got to the counter in inverness airport the agent told u there were not seat chose even though we had prove and the boarding who wa sent by email showing the seat then the agent put the senior almost at the end of the airplane and in the middle seat so once again more walking for them problem to get in out the seat and of course problem to get to the washroom luggage another problem british airway in inverness said that the luggage go directly to victoria and that we did not have to pick it up in vancouver surprise surprise we went through custom and when we got to westjet counter for the connection to victoria they asked for the luggage they said we had to pick it up before going through custom there wa no way to go back to the carousel so we had to wait for the westjet staff to contact somebody from british airway to get u to the carrusel and take the luggage so nightmare again and another rush to u to get to the next fligh according to westhet agent they said that british airway should have had the assistance for the senior and of course pick the luggage with them and bring it to the connection what can you expect from british airway if it doesn t even care about the passenger that are senior and requested assistance we can only thank westjet staff who provide the assistance in vancouver,positive
london to berlin tegel return it s becoming ever more difficult to notice any difference between british airway and the budget airline the only saving grace is that i ve never experienced any issue flying out of or into t noticeable cost cutting measure include the removal of complimentary onboard food and drink but also ba have removed a toilet in economy within their a fleet to make space for seat in row and meaning there is only one economy toilet disgraceful my flight to berlin wa busy and the line for the sole toilet existed throughout the duration of the flight meaning the flight attendant couldn t offer an efficient trolley service and involved a continual display of other passenger weaving in and out of aisle seat i feel for the staff who often work tirelessly,positive

flew newcastle to san francisco via london heathrow with british airway one issue after another the flight from newcastle boarded early but due to weather condition in london we departed late we should have had a two hour lay over for our connecting flight but arrived only thirty minute prior to departure to san francisco and were told at disembarkation that we had been re routed via washington our booked flight to san francisco also departed late and we sat in the lounge watching it push back we finally got on the washington bound aircraft but were again delayed in order to allow late arriving passenger from amsterdam to catch the flight the delay meant that the late departure wa then caught up in a computer problem at heathrow thus delaying the flight further we eventually arrived in washington twenty minute before the next connecting flight there wa an announcement over the tannoy system for u to hurry up but no physical help available obviously we missed the flight and spent the next hour around about trying to find help at the check in desk in a practically empty airport united acting on behalf of ba checked u onto a flight the following morning and the ba staff eventually found u a hotel room thirty minute drive away ironically the ba personnel had been busy ensuring the the passenger from amsterdam that had caused the late departure made their connecting flight and were therefore not available to help u we were also downgraded to economy on the flight between washington and san francisco a business class wa full we eventually got to san francisco about hour after our scheduled arrival ba offered no compensation for either the time lost or the down grade in class they did pay for the taxi from the hotel and the cost of the pre booked but unused hotel in san francisco the airline blamed everything on circumstance and would not accept any responsibility not a good experience at all and nobody really care,negative

this wa really a no frill business class this flight wa part of trip with qatar airway unfortunately the london to doha wa operated by british airway the seat is cramped and really outdated compared to the other major airline the ife wa really poor with old screen system and poor range of option the meal wa not good related to the price you have to pay the fa were really dull nothing wrong but no effort to communicate with passenger like fa from other airline ba really need to refresh or renovate their business class cabin it might be excellent innovation back in mid s but the industry ha moved on,positive
british airway is seriously lacking in all area singapore to sydney return in economy fly the route often usually with qantas which are great the flight out to sydney is only hour and over night most people are looking to maximise their sleep especially those who have come from london cabin crew were surly unhelpful and seemed rushed and disorganised after departure they took almost three hour to get the dinner service over and done with and turn off the light so people could get some rest during the flight cabin crew chatted loudly and seemed unaware that people may actually want to rest and get some sleep the food is very average also two hour before landing they serve a pre landing breakfast snack of a sandwich wrapped in plastic no tea or coffee the competition is too strong for this route i would never use them again,positive
london heathrow to basel boarding there are now so many priority boarding passenger that all those who do not fall into this category are left to feel like second class citizen the new numbering system is likely to cement this impression further since i wa traveling on a low price ticket i found myself seated right at the back of the airplane yes ba appears intent on replicating england s class system on board there wa a delay of minute due to a french atc strike obviously this wa not ba s fault but no drink not even water wa offered during the wait on the tarmac after take off the drink trolley moved painfully slowly down the cabin why ba offer heated sandwich further slowing down their bob service even further when only two ec cabin crew are serving in the first place is beyond me the no cash policy further contributes to the snail pace progress of the trolley the trolley and a cup of tea wa within grasping distance a the captain announced we would be landing in ten minute end of service someone at the back quipped so you opted for the premium seat too yes ba is a joke it attitude towards passenger it customer shameless and embarrassing it wasn t until i had left the airport that i wa able to get that cup of tea needless to say eurowings and easyjet do thing much better,negative
miami to london heathrow a bit of a mixed bag boarding at miami wa conducted efficiently and the flight departed on time albeit that some passenger were still getting into their seat a the aircraft wa pushed back so much for safety seat would not remain in the upright position resulting in an uncomfortable flight and subsequent aching back on arrival at heathrow also my wife s ife failed mid flight impossible to hear information from the flight deck these ageing s really are in desperate need of replacement the congealed chicken curry wa disgusting and unpalatable the alternative pasta dish wa deemed acceptable the minimal breakfast offering leaf a lot to be desired the only redeeming feature wa the excellent service provided by the young enthusiastic cabin crew they must feel very demoralised given the poor quality product they have to support flight arrived early and luggage wa delivered promptly,positive

cape town to london i can report a positive experience on our flight from the moment we boarded cabin crew were polite and efficient and provided a high class service throughout seat e f suffer a bit from poor storage space and a lack of privacy but they are the best for a couple glass were kept topped up even before take off the menu provided four choice of both starter and main and all the dish were both well presented and well cooked talking to cabin crew it seems that staff are now being trained to prepare and present food with greater care and this really showed on the flight the ife screen wa the usual low resolution with a limited selection of film still no wifi of course take off and landing wa on schedule and announcement from the cockpit had that typical air of friendly professionalism an excellent flight overall,positive
bangkok to london heathrow despite all the negative review i decided to fly with ba on my recent trip to europe on this route ba ha a daylight flight i can t stand midnight plus departure and night flight where you can t sleep anyway and arrive at your destination wasted more luggage allowance in premium economy and they advertised what seemed to be a comfortable cabin and stylish service the fare wa also pretty good in the end i have to admit my mate were right this wa a let down all along my issue were the following i purchased a ticket in premium economy the advertised seat on the ba thailand website were reflecting the newer version when in fact not one of the which operates the lhr bkk lhr route have been refitted the seat date from the early s almost two decade ago and i had to pay pound each way to select my seat come on yes i got my amenity kit a better pillow british paper and pre departure drink a full bar and plenty of drink to keep me going for hr plus but the seat is old not that comfy the ife belongs to the late s and is a disgrace to the industry great sound good headset but rubbish tiny screen with a poor picture quality i spent hr looking at the ceiling a i could not see squat the seat itself is way outdated and the cabin seat were dirty it wa however a bit better out of lhr but still not that great the meal service wa not good out of bkk bar service did not have peanut or savory snack just a napkin main dish wa ok but appetizer and dessert a cheap joke no cheese nor cracker not enough at all you are left starving and in economy it is even worst i have to say it wa better on the return leg and will give you more detail in a bit cabin crew told me they just reverted to the old style a they have had way too many complaint and the j c had a brand new a la carte service a well cabin crew operating both leg were great professional approachable and present in the cabin every min with drink out of lhr the main meal wa this time pretty good including cheese and cracker and a much better appetizer plus desert the only false note wa the meal pre selection you get served first a they do with special meal but do not offer you any drink you have to wait for a very long time by then my meal wa cold and i sent it back they did replace it right away but this wa clearly a waste of time pre selecting your meal mean you are sure to get your choice of casserole and that you wish to be served at the same time then others so the bar is right behind and one can enjoy a glass of red with is steak pax with special meal service can wait a the crew have way more to hand out and these veggie lover often do not drink anyway other than that it wa this time a decent meal having said that there wa no middle service which meant h between lunch and breakfast without even a snack not acceptable on such a long haul funny enough the bkk lhr feature three meal so why not on the lhr bkk leg ba could be so much better they have a great force but way too many cost cutting left and right and should have upgraded all their fleet at least year ago it is clear to me the ceo is running ba to the ground and need to get the sack by share holder sooner rather than later,positive

tel aviv to london we arrived at the airport with a lot of time due to the story of how long security can take the story were true although it is actually a very efficient and well organised airport they just have very thorough border and immigration service a well a all passenger face enhanced security scanning of hand luggage etc there were limited priority option available for first class passenger although i suspect that is more down to the airport than british airway the lounge provided is a third party one and is the same for business and first and isn t really acceptable if it wa just business then it would be fine i guess but there is not very much seating the food offering were almost non existent and drink were limited even the main coffee machine wa broken so there wa another very complicated machine with all instruction only in hebrew at the gate there wa the usual priority boarding queue a well a the regular queue but the priority queue included all first and club passenger a well a all oneworld emerald sapphire and ruby member which is a lot of people whilst it is nice to offer a perk to all of those member there really should be another queue for first and oneworld emerald a the queue wa quite long the service on board didn t start off very well for me a due to some confusion amongst the crew i got missed out when crew were offering drink amenity kit etc and after seeing every one wa finished and the crew were all relaxing at the front i had to go to the galley and ask they were very apologetic and provided excellent service for the rest of the flight but those kind of mistake really shouldn t happen in first the seat is comfortable and offer a reasonable level of privacy and storage space annoyingly the ife ha to be stowed for take off and landing which limit how much you can watch it wa the thales entertainment system so the quality wa reasonable and with a fairly good selection of thing to watch the food and drink on board were all excellent including a delicious veal cheek main course and some wonderful wine that went together very well aside from the hiccup at the beginning the whole experience on board felt very attentive and special it would have been nice to have been referred to by name which i have had before on ba and with other airline even in business class on arrival the priority bag came out incredibly quickly and were on the belt before we got there which wa impressive a immigration had also been very quick overall this wa a very nice flight with a solid product and excellent crew let down only by the ground service in israel i used avios and a companion voucher for this flight so it worked out excellent value for money,positive
london to tel aviv arrived at heathrow at about pm expecting it to be very busy but check and security felt like it wa pm very easy and quick process which included regular rather than fast track security a we didn t follow the sign properly we used gallery south lounge and first impression were actually pretty poor although they did later improve the food offering on arrival wa a few sandwich soup and some dry cake this wasn t really acceptable at all although about an hour after we arrived the evening meal were laid out and there wa a good selection of hot and cold dish which were quite tasty drink overall were good a always with british airway although champagne is only served on request and the quality of the one provided wa really quite appalling in term of seating there wa enough for all the passenger in there and it wa quite busy and due to it being broken up into different area it felt like a nice place although better variety in seating including some more comfortable chair would be appreciated a well a a bit of modernising this biggest failing wa the staff in the lounge which were more similar to staff in a factory canteen than what you find in competitor lounge smile are free and go a long way and whilst being unobtrusive can be a good quality eerily walking around slightly like a zombie seruptitiously clearing your table without any interaction whatsoever wa just plain odd the other area which i find completely below standard are the toilet whilst they are kept clean and there are some nice touch with flower etc the general standard of the toilet decor wa more like a cheap gym locker room the regular heathrow airport toilet are far far nicer and to a higher quality whilst the individual toilet cubicle with self contained wash area are nice there aren t really enough and some regular wash room facility and urinal a well would make it easier on board me and my friend had the centre two seat at the very back of the cabin this meant that we basically had our own private suite a well a direct aisle access these seat are fantastic when travelling with someone and a good a any business offering from any airline in term of comfort privacy and access unfortunately this wa an ancient with the old ife which is a completely unacceptable product in term of resolution selection and even the fact that some screen won t even stay in place and fold themselves away british airway need to have an active plan to refurbish or replace all of these aircraft end of story even the thales system is showing it age now but this rockwell collins one make vhs tape look state of the art the cabin crew were slightly mixed in term of level of service and experience some were clearly not in sync with each other when serving drink and meal etc and some were rather abrupt and unfriendly others however were absolutely wonderful and made the whole flight a wonderful experience food and drink on board were actually quite good although the on board service wa not the new club world one on this route yet overall it wa a very enjoyable flight and a i booked using avios and a companion voucher it wa exceptional value for money having said that i would have still considered it good value even if paying cash,positive

london heathrow to seoul incheon i wa flying my return leg back to korea after a christmas vacation i had not had a pleasant experience on my initial leg and unfortunately had no better experience on the return to start with i wa unable to pre order my meal on line due to a technical fault having not had my selection available on the outbound leg in business class i wanted to ensure i had something for my return i couldn t pre book and of course when offered the meal by the cabin crew they had again run out of of the available selection quite disgraceful i wa also unable to check in on line so i wa directed by staff to use the kiosk at the airport which also did not work eventually i made it passed the staff and wa allowed to queue for the business class check in the rest of the airport process after that wa smooth this time i sat at the rear of the business class cabin in the window seat this meant that i did not have to step over somebody else foot and leg if i wanted to get out of my chair in flight of course i had to pay extra s for the seat selection in business class a point which i have made before about being very unhappy about in a premium cabin the flight wa uneventful on this occasion i had a very warm crew for which i appreciated overall i still feel that ba is just too cheap on it s product and this is not an acceptable practice especially in a premium class frankly even though they were the cheaper ticket price by the time i had paid extra for the seat and not had my meal choice available i would have been better off flying another carrier,negative
seoul incheon to london heathrow this wa my first flight on ba for many year a a brit i wa actually looking forward to flying them in order to return home for christmas on board the relatively new b i wa disappointed the fare i paid on this occasion wa relatively good value for a j class cabin in my view however it wa extremely disappointing to see that you have to pay to select your seat in j class i do not know of and have not ever flown another airline which charge you for this and i certainly do not appreciate it i wa seated in row by the window my first experience in this cabin wa a shock when i realised i wa looking straight into the face of the passenger sitting next to me and further that i had to step over the leg of the passenger in row to get into and out from my seat the tray table did not sit straight when pulled out for service even in row by the time the cabin crew came to take my meal order they were already telling me that two of the available option had already run out this left me taking a korean option on a flight on ba where the majority of the passenger seemed to be non korean clearly something wrong with the meal ratio they offer a serve yourself snack bar in flight i went to the galley at one point and there wa very little available to take food wise it wa mostly just drink it also seemed to be a fixed meal time something else i do not appreciate in business class these day when dine on demand is a far better option for passenger the ife selection wa nothing more than average i found the overall selection somewhat limited compared to other carrier the service and product simply left me feeling that ba is way behind other carrier and i concluded that i would not make a point of flying with them again on a long haul route in a premium cabin,positive
flew cape town to london with british airway it s hard to think of a good thing about this flight on the outward journey i wa in an aisle seat next to me wa somebody who wa too large to comfortably be able to occupy a middle seat the crew could have helped the poor person out by offering an aisle but they made no attempt so three people suffered cramped condition for hour the food is awful poor quality and with poor selection of wine cheap spanish wine with no choice the cabin wa over heated it wa the most uncomfortable flight i have ever taken until my return flight entertainment system wa not working ancient plane same miserable food this airline used to be good now it is awful,negative
london to bahrain club world and they certainly like to pack folk into a business class cabin in a configuration which is out of date and hardly worthy of business class cabin compared to the like of qatar emirate etihad which are far more superior the plane wa old along with a tired cabin and dirty unkempt bathroom basin that had permanent staining which need replacing on this flight good choice of food with attentive staff cost cutting wa in evidence in the amenity bag you get the presentation of food tray and the personnel service had gone it s more akin to economy also a real negative point is your at heathrows newest terminal guess what you are transported to your aircraft by bus a shining example of what is supposed to be a modern airport this flight is definitely not star and a star rating is where this airline should sit plane wa delayed min arrived min late so not exactly a good timekeeping record either ife wa poor with old film that they call new release no where near on a par with qatar airway,positive

british airway short haul business class is nothing more than an economy class seat and maximum inch pitch with lounge access and a meal thrown in so is it worth paying three time the cost of an economy ticket ba recently introduced business class on domestic route and a i got a decent price for booking well in advance decided to try it out checking in wa efficient and the gallery club lounge adequate no comparison whatsoever with asian or middle eastern airline lounge priority boarding although announced did not make any difference a economy and business class passenger were in the same queue and confused having maneuvered into the cramped seat i wa offered a hot towel a soon a i sat down i couldn t decide whether to be amused or embarrassed by the new celebrity cast safety video it wa more spot the star than listen to the safety instruction but i guess it wa something different ba wa trying out the service on board wa surprisingly efficient and swift soon after take off a tasty snack and bar service with premium brand wa offered on this one hour flight the service wa good considering a one hour flight despite a boeing x x layout the cabin felt claustrophobic to me this wa no different than economy seating with virtually no leg room how can this be branded a business class is the extra cost justified to fly club europe absolutely not,positive

am continually disappointed by british airway it seems they are now in a race with ryanair and easyjet to become the worst carrier in and out of the uk flew d sseldorf to london their lounge at dus is closed but their check in staff doesn t know that she sent me up there i have a connexion at jfk and i showed her the boarding pass but she wouldn t interline my bag to their partner aa and i had to recheck it now not only do they not serve a second meal on the hour flight lhr lax but now they want for a can of coca cola that they pay p for usually you should always fly across the ocean on a european carrier but with boac i recommend finnair or american with their one world alliance what is the point,negative
london to santiago cabin crew generally helpful and friendly cabin a bit grubby crumb nut and grime in evidence on the flight home a i took my seat i saw a bit of the wrapper of the ear plug they give out which seemed to have been left over from the previous flight evidence that whoever wields the vacuum cleaner before the passenger board need to be a bit more thorough the alcoholic drink were all pleasant the food wa of variable quality a wa the coffee none bad some a bit mediocre some good many have commented on the somewhat odd seat arrangement and i found it a bit of a palaver to have to carefully step over another sleeping passenger s leg trying not to wake them up the other problem with that configuration is the video screen ha to be stowed at take off and landing which mean you can t watch it a you can in economy when the screen is on the back of the seat in front of you on both flight i found that my screen seemed to be broken and would not lock in position so that i would have to look at it at an angle i solved the problem by stuffing a rolled up magazine in the hinge bit but then i had to take it out every time i got out of my seat another problem with the configuration is that the storage space is minimal apart from the overhead locker there is only a small drawer and that add to the litter problem after you have taken off the polythene wrapper for your headphone and blanket or the paper ring around your napkin what do you do with it er drop it on the floor i did manage to sleep quite well though the pillow you are provided with is very thin on the flight back they gave me another one when i asked another small problem is that there is no individual air conditioning vent for your seat and if you take off your jacket sweater or whatever the lack of storage space mean it ha to go in the overhead locker if you have already filled up the little drawer and i don t want to seem a bit picky but although the in flight entertainment ha a good choice of film the menu system for seeing what they are is a bit irritating they are all divided into category such a comedy thriller etc but no a z all in all it wasn t an unpleasant experience but i would advise ba if they were interested in my advice that they need to clean the plane more often and more thoroughly and re think the seat configuration,positive
london to new york jfk in club world after reading very mixed review here i also saw that ba were upgrading standard on flight to nyc in particular and wa looking forward to my flight should not have been so optimistic a this is still a business class that belongs in the s aircraft wa tatty to be polite about it worn carpet seat with various malfunctioning or broken item washroom grimy from the word go staff tried hard to offer a modicum of good service but the so called food improvement were really not much better than other premium economy cabin i have flown when i have to pay for the ticket ba talk a lot about their premium standard but even when you pay to dollar for business class the standard are well below even their u counterpart complete rip off sum it up,positive
my wife and i booked two round trip business class air ticket from johannesburg to victoria fall with british airway comair it turned out that our business class seat were not any different from the seat in the economy class they had exactly the same width and pitch actually british airway simply separated several seat in the front from the rest of the aircraft cabin with a curtain and called this a business class moreover our pre flight accommodation were not any better than those of the economy class passenger because british airway doe not even have a lodge for business class passenger in victoria fall yes during the flight we were served sparkling wine and snack but doe this difference substantiate my paying for two round trip ticket rather than which would have been the cost of the economy class ticket,positive
london to mumbai the electric at my seat were not working this may have been related but the remote control that wa completely broken with loose wire etc the call button light kept coming on and off on it own it wa impossible for me to control this and at the time that i did actually want to contact the flight attendant i had to use my husband s remote control to do so because the connection wa loose on my remote it meant that thing were changing on my tv screen without me being able to control it e g i would press play on the screen then the program would pause or start rewinding without me doing anything because my remote controller wa broken it would not return properly into the socket and kept pinging back out this wa annoying when you are trying to relax in your seat the tv screen wa faulty the usual push and release button did not work i had to push the button and then just try to pull the screen it wa very tough even the cabin crew could not release it properly my footrest wa very stiff and hard to manoeuvre on my own my husband had to help every time i wanted to move this my husband footrest wa broken the charging socket at my seat did not work so i could not charge my phone or laptop for the entire flight my husband charging socket also did not work the flight attendant told me that this wa an issue on some of the other seat in our row this is not related to my seat however the storage unit above my seat row kept opening throughout the flight the attendant would shut it and then it would open this happened during take off and landing a well a throughout the flight for this level of airline and club world seat it is not acceptable that you should have to rely on your personal equipment this return flight wa the first time that i have flown business class we have spent ten of thousand of pound on our american express card to earn the point required and to generate the companion voucher for u to be able to fly business class for our honeymoon whilst the outbound flight wa great i wa very disappointed with the return flight and shocked by the poor quality of the seat the hostess tried to reset my screen which made no difference and in fact the situation got worse once i had tried to turn on the screen and once it the hostess had attempted a re set after that the screen just kept flicking on and off for the remaining hr of the flight a you can imagine it is very annoying to have a screen flick on and off with no way of controlling it it wa impossible to turn the screen off completely,negative
i travelled to johannesburg from london heathrow on sunday nd october on flight ba and my husband wa meant to travel with my two daughter on the same flight on rd october they were refused boarding on the ground that child cannot travel with a single parent to south africa there wa no such requirement on booking the ticket via ba s website and there wa no notification of this by the airline at any stage the requirement is not even on the front page of the embassy s website but well hidden under drop down menu usually when there are requirement like for esta for entry into u ba sends a prompt however there wa nothing in this case ba had on it system that i the other parent had travelled ba already reach johannesburg a day before the ba counter staff at the airport refused to help my husband who wa travelling with a and year old with any alternative instead they directed to use the website to cancel ticket after being given the wrong email address first when finally managed to get in touch with customer relation they refused to refund the ticket cost only refunded tax of total the overall service and the way it wa dealt wa extremely stressful at the airport and off putting they said they would use the complain to improve their process but will not refund in excess of gbp k in ticket a they were cancelled prior to the flight upon refused boarding even the return flight and not within hr of booking other airline offer alternative but here the attitude wa extremely dismissive even though both my husband and i are frequent traveller and have silver card of their executive program i will avoid travelling ba even for work after this event have received better treatment from low cost airline in the past,negative
heathrow to lyon the worst customer service i have ever experienced i arrived at the airport a good hour before the flight only to be told that the flight is overbooked and that i could not check in after a long wait to ascertain if anyone will not be turning up i wa told i can go on a different flight the problem being that the only available flight wa the one going out the following morning so i missed a whole day s business meeting and wa forced to do the round trip home and back to the airport in a matter of one day when i queried the fact that i wa unable to board i wa told that overselling the flight wa normal all airline do it the fact that all of them do it of course is not a justification nor explanation i wa casually advised to read the small print in the future on the way back from my destination in order to avoid the same thing happening i decided to check in online hour before however i wa again denied a check in and wa put on a stand by apparently the return flight is overbooked again i do not understand how it is possible that the product service that i have purchased i can not use how can it be legal that the company ha no responsibility to honour their contractual obligation to provide me the service that i have duly purchased a good month in advance the disregard for it customer and the sheer arrogance of this huge inept company is beyond pale on top of that the company s decision to no longer serve coffee tea and food on board is unacceptable the ba ha made a foolish decision to behave like a budget airline but still keep charging premium price i certainly will never travel the ba ever again,negative

singapore to london my feedback seems to mirror many other user here ba standard are just getting worse and worse and i am talking about business class which i thought they would maintain the cabin interior wa worn and quite grubby the seat terrible and now must be one of the poorest for long haul business class the meal and presentation is really a joke and on my previous long haul biz trip i got better food in lufthansa premium economy cabin staff were quite friendly although they do hide in the galley a lot chatted to one of them who said so many customer are complaining and even deserting ba because of the fall in standard i m not surprised and i for one would not use them again for long haul time for senior management change a the present ceo clearly ha no clue how to run what wa once a premium airline now they do little more than a low cost and easyjet for one is far superior and nicer for short hop in europe,negative
british airway appear to be taking positive step to lift their game the service on this flight wa flight wa materially better than that previously experienced the quality of the food served had lifted materially the staff were helpful the big downside is that club europe set remains stock standard economy seat with the middle seat blocked off the pitch is tight too tight in my view another couple of centimetre would be welcome overall a better ba experience,positive

london to toronto by now it is nothing new anymore that the ceo very aggressive cost cutting affected all class including first business which called club world doe not deserve it name because it is simply appalling again it is on the cost of the customer and eventually on the aircrew who have to work harder because there are smaller team it is not surprising that ba current ranking bounced back to th from th in fact is that this airline which prefers rather to invest it money in flashy nonsense commercial rather than in it product doe clearly not deserve to be recommended once a grand airline today just another star airline like there are so many,negative

gatwick to marrakech the cabin crew wa lazy and rude refusing to sell a pack of sweet which would have not taken more than second for the duration of half of the flight they sat in the back having a break during which all service stopped half way through the flight we ordered some sweet from the food menu the lady that passed said that they will come back once they had finished serving some other customer after minute we pressed the bell for assistance and one of the staff came to rudely explain that they hadn t finished serving other customer even though none of the staff member wa seen serving anyone we waited minute before pressing the bell again which wa ignored after another minute my partner went to the back of the cabin to order the pack of sweet but the cabin crew explained that they are having a break now and that they stopped serving we tried for over hour to buy some jaffa cake which would have taken less than second but it wa too much to ask for ryanair or easyjet service is luxury compared to the service of this cabin crew i will not use ba again if i can avoid it and cannot recommend this airline,negative

gatwick to marrakech generally a well organised flight and fairly full in y class my gripe is about the current food service this wa a fairly long short haul flight scheduled for h m in which a reasonable meal service would be welcome and desirable after a lot of comment from others who have flown ba recently we bought food in the terminal before departure a the coho ice on board is very limited especially a much seems to be already sold out the biggest issue is about the time taken to do the food selling it took almost all of the flight time for the crew to work through the plane to serve every row even though i observed that about of passenger bought nothing of course this led to problem for those wishing to go to the toilet at the rear when food service start at the front any passenger from front to middle have no access to aft toilet after the trolley ha passed passenger resorted to using the forward toilet passing through business class which i assume wa not welcomed by those passenger i overheard a crew member saying that they were not going to duty free sale a they were out of time it is ridiculous that this paid and limited service take so long i remember the day when a british midland crew could serve a full cooked breakfast with tea or coffee to all or so pax on a lhr to middlesbrough flight scheduled for minute or an aer lingus crew serving hot breakfast to all on a turbulent flight of hr from dublin to london if ba want to differentiate themselves from low cost carrier then this is not the way to do it,positive

pisa to gatwick i fly this route often a i have a home in tuscany believe me it doe not get any better but the option is ryanair and that s worse flight started in the new south terminal lounge the decor and layout of the facility is great no problem here although it s located in a not so easy place to find breakfast food wa ghastly cheap bap with greasy bacon or a dried up eggy thing horrible didn t touch it and those that did left it a confirmed by numerous plate with half eaten bap had tinned fruit salad and yoghurt plus a g t yes i know bit early in the day short walk to the gate plane left on time the usual horrible for seat in club europe the front row made it easier but only just had a pleasant lunch of chicken and couscous salad the plane wa very old this wa confirmed by the wc originally the loo flush button wa blue after us the blue wa partly eroded by finger press to a grey colour the loo basin cannot be described here plane landed on time the captain came out and i had a nice chat with him very nice bloke return flight started in the shared lounge it okay but can get busy same plane back recognizable by the flush button in the loo unless all the ba s are like it skipped the meal a i d eaten lunch in pisa it looked nice though a few gin and tonic to suppress my irritation at what a shoddy product club europe is great flight back into the setting sun fa on all flight were great morale very low thanks to the miserable mean cost cutting by the ba ceo mr cruz who ha no idea on how to run an airline i first flew ba in and what a difference decline is sad and depressing to see a verified by of review here be so negative time to find a new ceo i think,positive
la vega to london heathrow this particular boeing must have been one resurrected from storage in the desert the condition of this aircraft wa appalling the first class cabin wa literally falling apart with loose yellowed bin and filthy carpet the entertainment system wa old and slow and low definition the premium economy cabin wa directly behind first class and those passenger kept using the first class toilet it didn t matter because they were filthy the dinner in first class wa inedible british airway are now a national embarrassment british airway are at best a three star airline and maybe even a two star carrier compared to their competitor,negative
london city to edinburgh flight left on time and arrived early impressed with the legroom on the embraer much more comfortable than ba s a s check in security and boarding all went smoothly and quickly cabin crew were efficient light snack and drink provided on this short flight would fly with ba again on short sector and lcy is an excellent airport to use,positive
faro to gatwick check in wa quiet at the club europe desk and i wa very quickly booked in fast track security at the airport wasn t particularly well managed although i did get through quicker than i would have otherwise disappointingly british airway do not provide any lounge access at faro and there is currently a lot of construction taking place in the main departure lounge and the builder are not exactly considerate with the noise there wa no priority queue at the entrance to the gate and a usual british airway did a fairly half hearted job at ensuring priority boarding of the aircraft itself the aircraft wa the new style which i think is very smart and nicely decorated not budget airline a some commentator like to say and whilst the legroom isn t amazing i am tall and wa quite comfortable and having the extra table space make it a more usable space the cabin crew were very friendly and professional whilst also being very efficient a bar service with nut wa delivered soon after take off along with the menu for the flight all of the cold part of the meal and the drink were excellent sadly the chicken main wa quite overcooked leading to dry chicken and soggy veg that being said it tasted very nice arriving into gatwick wa a dream especially for a large airport although the building are quite old and not laid out a well a newer one they have done a fantastic job at modernising it and making security very quick it took a little while for bag to reach the belt but priority bag all came out first so the process wa fairly painless i got a good deal on the flight so i would say it wa reasonably good value for money although the experience in faro airport doe reduce the premium feel considerably,positive
los angeles to london heathrow the inflight entertainment wa not working so no tv video music or radio usb socket not working headphone not working customer service very poor cabin crew seemed to be unaware that they were carrying paying passenger upon whom their job depend food mediocre there wa no apple juice or tomato juice on the dinner trolley and the cabin crew didn t bother to fetch any tea served with breakfast wa luke warm and stewed no refreshment supplied unless collected from the galley it took day to get through to customer relation many call cutting off after minute others cancelled after going through option i cannot recommend british airway who in my case certainly did not fly to serve the experience wa far below expectation and definitely at the lower budget range for customer service a the british flag carrier the experience wa shameful my last flight with this airline,negative
malaga to gatwick they ve introduced new cabin baggage allowance ultimately that mean everyone try to jam their huge case into the overhead locker resulting in a ryanair like scuffle they now charge for food this would be fine if it didn t take the single food trolley the entire duration of most short haul flight to get all the way down the plane on my previous three flight with the new ba we ve been left for over an hour and a half the last flight wa actually over two hour without any service a the economy passenger are not allowed to use business class toilet there wa a long queue of passenger stuck behind the trolley desperately trying to get to the toilet at the back of the plane on the other end of the trolley a whole bunch of passenger waiting for a scrap of food and drink two hour after take off the cabin crew seem genuinely fed up one of the key reason for flying ba wa their friendly cabin crew service this ha now been absolutely and totally undermined by the company giving them no time or energy by the look of it to be nice ultimately if price is everything make sure you check norwegian before you spend any money with ba if price isn t everything don t fly ba,positive
london heathrow to bangkok wa looking forward to eventually flying with british airway after flying reguarly to bangkok with other airline how disappointed i wa a low budget product with a premium price i will never again use this airline it the most costly option usually for my regular journey to thailand but it rank the lowest of all the airline i ve used on this route in past trip seatback screen so small and of poor quality service is dreadful seat are old with no powerpoints no wifi on board best part of the trip wa getting off absolutely shameful for a national carrier of the uk lower your cost ba a you really are budget go fly with any of the gulf airline or a vast majority of europe s best ba are nowhere near good enough current price almost a rd more than the other direct flight eva and thai to bangkok and british airway is only half a good a those,negative

malaga to gatwick our return trip from holiday wa equally pleasant check in at malaga wa a breeze although security wa packed even though a quiet sunday vip lounge at malaga used by ba and other airline apparently it the only one there is pretty useless compared with the old ba lounge that used to be there cost cutting guess we were spoiled by gatwick drink okay but limited food pretty awful but seating comfortable and it is very spacious flight left on time and again arrived half an hour early due i guess to help from hurricane ophelia which i guess we were on the fringe of in board catering and drink up to the usual quality and very pleasant crew chatted to the first officer nice man all in all we were well looked after in this class so can t complain,positive
gatwick to malaga first flight with ba from new home at south terminal at london gatwick upon arrival at check in at a m wa a bit disappointed to see few staff available to deal with business class passenger resulting in a minute wait to sort out our bag however fast track through custom wa efficient and made up for the earlier minor irritation new lounge in south terminal is spacious and food and beverage up to the usual good quality although sadly the reduction towards a cheap airline is showing in the crack a to malaga wa uneventful and onboard food wa well presented and of good quality we arrived min ahead of schedule due to fortunate wind so cannot complain overall flight quality ha to be excellent,positive
london heathrow to nice deliberate extortion by ba in my opinion i booked an economy basic return from nice to london with ba day before the outbound i had to make a change to the outbound flight and go a day earlier i ended up buying a new single outbound flight a ba app crashed when i tried to change or cancel just the original outbound flight in the uk i received a medsage that my return flight wa ready for check in from ba however app again gave up and said i had logged in too many time upon arrival at heathrow i wa told ba had cancelled my return booking a i had multiple booking they said i had to pay approx to buy a new single ticket home even after i explained my situation i argued that had i been informed that they had cancelled my flight day ago when they did i could have at least bought a cheaper flight even the day before when i got the check in open message would have allowed me to book cheaper eventually the customer relation manager offered a ticket for charging me again for tax a i needed to get back and there wa no time to go to gatwick for cheaper flight i had no choice but to pay term and condition may well tell that flight will be cancelled but when i asked ticket person how many people he think read t c he said he would not like to comment,negative
gatwick to orlando return worst ever long haul business class flight we have experienced many airline and many different class of travel over the year but this most recent flight highlight the depth to which british airway have descended not the world s favourite airline by far we have never liked ba s business class club world seat since they changed over to the yin yang layout of seat across the cabin the seat layout together with the poor service meant we can honestly say this wa the worst ever long haul business class flight we have experienced to this day i have never understood how from a health and safety viewpoint the caa regulator ever allowed this seat configuration in the first place unless you are sat in an aisle seat cabin crew have to reach over other passenger to pas hot drink meal which is just ridiculous true this happens in other seat class a well but usually at a less precarious angle and generally not from behind your head in order to get out of the centre seat row e and f and the window seat you have to climb over another passenger s foot if they have their foot rest down and seat reclined in the dimmed cabin lighting this is tricky and potentially dangerous a a minimum you normally end up kicking the passenger you are climbing over we are both able bodied but anybody less mobile would really struggle to get out into the aisle for whatever reason you almost feel imprisoned in the centre seat and you are often also ignored because the cabin crew just pas by quickly often from behind you so by the time you notice them they have gone we should not have to use a call button just to get basic service the return leg wa a night flight the service overall wa very poor the crew just wanted to turn the light down asap the service at breakfast wa also poor the offering were inconsistent my wife struggled just to get an orange juice on her side of the cabin whereas i at least got that but struggled to get a second cup of coffee the entertainment system wa archaic very few recent film title the small screen resolution wa very poor this aircraft wa delivered to ba in march and it show it age this flight might have been a few hundred pound cheaper than competitor but in future we will pay the extra to get a decent seat and service ba are only getting away with retaining these dreadful seat versus aisle access for everybody because the corporate passenger market is letting them it is obvious if your employer is paying and say you can either choose to have an economy seat or one of those dreadful business class seat you will obviously choose the business class seat and put up with the difficulty and poor service it will be marginally better than being seated at the back but that doe not make it right we will probably never fly ba long haul business class club world again while we are paying for the ticket unless they stop being so arrogant and re configure their seating,negative
london to abu dhabi i told ba at check in that i would be interested in upgrading to premium economy if a window seat wa available the lady replied can i check you are only interested in upgrading if there is a window i replied yes after a series of phone call the upgrade wa processed i paid gbp my seat had no window or view at all a that seat is situated at the back of premium economy where the toilet should be when i complained i wa told that seat could not be guaranteed so i had no complaint no refund offered no token gesture offered nothing the food wa nice and the seat wa very comfortable if it wasn t for the rude customer service i would fly again i wa led to believe i could pay for a window seat and i paid in good faith i ve flown ba for year but this year ha been disappointing i won t fly with them again,positive

london to madrid in economy class late booking and quite an expensive ticket to fly from heathrow online check in and no luggage to check in so airport process wa okay boarding quite efficient cabin wa dirty carpet table and window all unpleasant and cannot believe a cleaner set foot from the earlier flight everything pay onboard if you want to eat or drink choice okay in brochure but the speed for serving this wa awful staff seemed to have real problem with all card payment and became bad tempered towards those of u wanting to buy i wouldn t have minded on a cheap ticket but this wa not a true case of rip off ba in will avoid if possible,negative

grand cayman to london i can t comprehend is why a flight that sum up to about hour of travel across the atlantic ocean only allows check in free bag for economy class upon returning to gcm from lon on october i had to pay for additional baggage particularly for university student such a myself who migrate from such distance to achieve good education in addition to the disgusting rate for additional baggage ha ba gotten so cheap that they no longer provide a complimentary travel toothbrush toothpaste eye mask for hour flight that wa one of the thing i appreciated most about ba a it made me feel valued i am truly disappointed with ba these day and whenever the day come that another airline travel directly to lon from gcm you guarantee i will abandon ba,positive
sydney to paris via london after flying with them i have to admit it s probably the worst airline i have been flying when i boarded the plane i notice some ketchup on the window and wall next to my i assume for long distance flight airline should provide you a mask for you to sleep ear plug maybe a small tube of toothpaste here you have some headphone and that s all with british airway you can order some special meal i received my first low callries meal a expected but they could not find the breakfast one of the cabin crew asked me if i ordered a special meal the plane looked quite old i tried ba never again,positive
larnaca to london heathrow the return trip from our holiday ba product wa more like a posh ryanair style of product even down to the asking for donation towards their charity there were a few noticeable difference on the aircraft there wa in flight entertainment if you were in a seat where you could view the tv screen on ryanair easyjet and other low cost airline you can pay using cash but no on ba it is card payment only in sterling the aircraft wa clean and tidy but overall the main ba product ha gone downhill and the service standard have slipped comparing this flight to my recent flight from london city with ba cityflyer there is a vast standard in the cabin service standard,positive
funchal to gatwick due to adverse weather our return flight wa delayed three day when we did fly the cabin crew appeared totally unaware of the fact that the passenger had had a difficult and frustrating time they were totally unsympathetic and provided a chaotic service throughout the flight the catering service wa absymal no choice of hot meal hardly a bar service and no tea coffee i suspect although the aircraft arrived empty from lgw they hadn t fully loaded the food drink trolley in contrast to the outgoing flight this wa a flight to be endured just show what a difference the crew can make,negative
orlando to gatwick the staff that looked after u flying out to florida and home were outstanding on the way home the seating had been already arranged and my seat wa separate from my two child i wa really worried about flying home away from my child i spoke to the flight supervisor who kindly asked two passenger if they would switch seat which they were happy to do the seat were very good and went back enough so you were able to get to sleep the only thing we weren t to happy with wa the movie but i guess you can t have everything all in all i would book to fly with ba again and would highly recommend,positive
flew leeds bradford to geneva via london heathrow british airway certainly shocked me with the budget low cost style my bag wa kg kg over the limit this meant i had to pay for two bag whilst only having one when i asked to take one item out and put it in my carry on to avoid paying an extra or so the answer wa no which wa odd considering the bag wa on the belt right infront of me on board the aircraft boarding wa prompt a clean sleek cabin i wa seated near the back close to the toilet which wasn t a problem beverage service wa okay everything wa over priced i bought a ginger ale for and it wa a cup which shocked me a it wa advertised a a full size can the only thing that wa free on board wa water for an international service on quite an expensive ticket it wa a little disappointing the crew were friendly and helpful but i couldn t help but overhear the crew conversation in the galley on descent into switzerland what they were talking about wa inappropriate especially how loud they were talking with child nearby apart from those thing the flight wa on time punctual and served the purpose which i paid for,positive
los angeles to doha via london great staff poor food and stupid cabin layout i m spoilt flying gulf airline but this time i tried a rear facing internal of configuration firstly staring in the face of my two new best friend seat facing forward wa at best weird and at worst like a business class speed dating experience crew could barely serve me ventilation wa restricted and access blocked by the foot rest of forward facing passenger once the security screen went up i felt like i wa in some sort of flying crypt and wa tempted to assume brace position to give the impression i had died and wa on a viewing the food wa embarrassing bad bigger serf of economy style food in bigger economy style bowl ba you have great crew trying to do their best with silly cabin engineering and poor catering support,positive
london heathrow to istanbul british airway is quite clearly in decline and with utter contempt for it customer even loyal one who have status like myself the overall feeling is of an airline that is miserly and skimping and greatly removed of the image that they try to portray of being a premium airline gallery south in t is large airy and well equipped and clean and wa not too busy on the sunday i travelled drink are well stocked but from the catering it is evident this is an airline scraping to do the bare minimum in what it offer the quality lacking with minuscule portion for breakfast and loading up of cheap carbs and curtailing of premium ingredient onboard it is similarly tired the plane had not been cleaned and my seat had food debris from the previous flight and stain on the tray table seating is cramped the cabin crew look dejected and have low morale onboard experience the service is no different than flying easyjet in fact i would argue worse there is no complimentary catering you are subjected to m s sandwich it is not cheap and or good value or any better than lcc offering service is slow and took the whole of hour of the flight meaning difficulty to going to the toilet due to the trolley blocking the aisle i wa even asked to wait until i wa finished which is ludicrous given it took the whole flight to serve people the slow service is due to the use of card only payment and also the fact the supplier doesn t allow their chilled item to be on the trolley which mean the ridiculous scenario of cabin crew constantly running to the galley to fetch item and further slowing it down on the return journey it clear ba doesn t care about it european or non north american route the lounge wa a contract lounge which wa very subpar in fact it wa dark dingy and furniture filthy but least the food wa decent overall if it wasn t for the fact i flew with ff mile and the low tax on redemption within europe i would never actually pay the full cash fare for this airline you get better more efficient service on the like of easyjet now within europe with no difference in overall product now complimentary catering ha been removed,positive

geneva to london british airway used to be my favourite airline however over the last year i have experienced some appalling service in pretty much every flight i have had with them i do fly with ba about time a year in this specific occasion my flight wa cancelled for apparent adverse weather this being in the middle of summer in a time where the weather wa excellent in both my departure arrival city i wa told abput this the day before in the afternoon bearing in mind i wa flying at am the morning after their communication wa made via text including a number to call back to re arrange my flight i must have call that number about time without success a the line were too busy when i managed to connect i have had to hold for an hour before the line died i have only managed to speak to them at pm that day when they told me they placed me on a flight hour later horrible customer service by the way the person i wa talking to couldn t care less i wa originally flying in business and i wa placed in economy instead i wa told that there wa no compensation for the delay because it wa due to the weather condition a lie of course a the weather wa still amazing in both country and promised a refund on the fare which to date about month later ha still not happened if you call them they transfer your call to india where if you are lucky you spend an hour waiting to end up speaking to someone unable to help what once wa the best airline is now worse than ryanair avoid if possible,positive

port of spain to gatwick via st lucia wa a good experience i don t have any complaint regarding the seat quality or flight attendant who did a very good job during the flight on keeping the passenger safe and serving meal and drink the seat wa comfortable enough a bit wider than on low cost flight i had extra space and a i noticed the leg room between seat wa regular i had a seat behind the bulkhead with enough leg room there wa a minor issue the flight had a stop at st lucia after which the new flight attendant insisted on waking up the people on the front row opened their entertainment system screen to show them the safety video which wa shown about an hour and a half on take off from port of spain i told them it s not necessary to view the video again and actually the video wa not available this time so this would be something the management should look into in flight entertainment wa good with no advertising which pleased me a lot i had a jolly passenger next to me in the middle seat who had a bit too much to drink and moved a lot in the seat sometimes talked louder than necessary but he wa still fun to have around and the flight attendant made sure in a very polite and funny way that he doe not disturb the other passenger there were minor issue during check in at the departure airport in port of spain the ba staff forgot to put a priority tag on my bag and give me a voucher for the lounge a i have a gold card on oneworld to use the lounge i had to use my priority pas not to waste time until the matter wa cleared with the ground staff i wa flying further from gatwick to istanbul on turkish airline hoping i would not have to change airport in london and a a result go through immigration take the baggage out check in again pas immigration and security again but ba doesn t have an agreement with turkish airline and i had to go through this lengthy process,positive

jersey to gatwick flight left on time and the plane wa clean and modern the crew were friendly the flight wa only minute and the crew worked hard to try and serve everyone who wanted to buy food or drink but i m not sure they made it to the final row i think the problem is that there are only staff to service the economy cabin whereas on our easyjet flight out there had been staff a there is no business class i still don t think the buy on board is working that well but that is not the crew s fault we were pleased to arrive minute early although it wa a shame to have to get a bus to the terminal the ba offering is now on a par with low cost carrier and a we got a competitive price for this flight we were fairly happy,positive
gatwick to tirana full flight on both outward and return journey the seating wa adequate for a short journey but only limited pitch the aircraft wa clean cabin crew were present and friendly throughout the journey but busy selling food and on board good the main advantage of this airline wa the direct flight from uk to tirana otherwise nothing special to recommend both flight on time,positive

i flew from london heathrow to sofia and back the plane on both flight wa an airbus and i d guess a young one judging by the freshness of the interior i am m foot tall and found the leg room and seat width to be fine i certainly didn t feel cramped even in the centre seat both flight departed the gate on schedule although actual take off on the outbound flight wa slightly delayed because of air traffic restriction over europe the cabin crew on both leg were pleasant and courteous on both flight the captain kept u very well informed of our route and our progress so far top mark to british airway but where they let themselves down is the shamble of a refreshment service it might seem like a minor gripe but i do like the opportunity to get something to eat or drink on a flight even if i have to pay for it which you do not on other legacy airline like lufthansa the range and price of food and drink on offer were comparable with low cost airline i have flown with but there the comparison end because whilst i have always been served quickly and sometimes twice on short haul low cost airline ba s service is too slow and seems to run out of stock too they also insist on card only transaction i had the misfortune to be sitting toward the rear of the plane on both leg and the a is a long plane a single trolley started from the front making ponderous progress towards me and even though the flight wa two hour and forty minute long i only just managed to get a coffee and sandwich from a slightly harried flight attendant who by now had returned the trolley and wa scuttling to and from the galley squeezing past the long queue of passenger waiting for the lavatory the coffee by the way wa excellent the return flight wa worse because the trolley made it two third down the aisle and wa getting tantalisingly close to me before abruptly stopping and returning to the galley leaving the remaining passenger unserved in conclusion clean plane punctual service pleasant cabin crew but awful refreshment service,positive
heathrow to bilbao boarding of the flight at heathrow wa very good the flight wa on time and the plane wa clean frequent flyer boarded first and the rest soon followed from then on the service wa very similar to a easy jet or eurowings flight the crew member s in economy passed through the cabin selling m s sandwich snack and coffee the flight out of bilbao wa delayed by a late incoming aircraft information on the delay wa a little slow in coming from the gate agent however the crew were very efficient loading the flight when it finally landed the flight crew also managed to shave minute off the flight time too however the service onboard is similar to eurowings both flight were safe and competent but the actual flight experience wa lacking and in future i will consider easyjet or similar a they offer the same level of service for less money,positive
kalamata to london heathrow no priority boarding at kalamata drink and food service poorly synchronised with no pre dinner drink no nut and bread served with main course lacto ovo vegetarian special included the same tomato and mozzarella starter a on the outbound flight despite a beetroot carpaccio dish being available on the standard menu the special main wa yet again a bland overcooked pasta dish overall a pathetic vegetarian offering cabin crew did the bare minimum in club europe and their main priority seemed to be selling the m s stuff in economy which they were doing up until minute from landing the club europe toilet wa grubby flight landed on schedule but there wa a long wait for baggage at t,negative
london heathrow to krakow i am a one world emerald member on aa so i get certain perk when flying british airway such a free seat selection lounge use and priority boarding that make this airline bearable just they are obsessed with carry on bag much like ryanair giving out silly yellow tag for carry on bag and checking carry on size not sure what it doe for them a it only increase their bag handling cost their seat are no better than anyone else and their pitch just a tight what used to set ba apart wa their inflight service even in coach a sandwich or something this ha degraded to nothing zero even a soft drink is charged so i asked for water i wa offered an evian for no thanks just plain water ok sir we will come back to you after we serve everyone else of course he never came back hour flight and not even allowed a cup of water ba are listed a a star airline aa are a star yet aa now have better inflight service than ba by a country mile ba are a bottom tier airline and nothing more to the average flier,positive

gatwick to mauritius very disappointing airline and service the facing each other seat are fun theoretically but when reality hit it s a mess why because you get other people stumbling on your foot during mid flight or is it just my luck and most the other passenger on business class were old and not flexible enough to jump over the foot stool and wake you mid sleep every time they need to use the restroom the tv monitor color are so off it wa a nightmare trying to enjoy any movie getting the brightness right to make the color work because if you don t want the monitor to blind you when it s snooze time good luck watching the movie in any other color than black and red the worst thing wa the food salad wa frozen the beef filet wa so dry and flavorless but too salty my partner s chicken wa swimming in a pool of oil and flavorwise it wa hitting all the wrong spot they believe in umami and dump a ton of msg on their food to make it taste edible but did they get that wrong i ended up eating bread and butter only same go for the scrambled egg for breakfast bacon wa extra salty and the fresh fruit bowl wa just a frozen a the salad overall very poor and disappointing experience,negative
dubai to london i am a regular ba flyer and so generally my expectation is low nowadays a they almost become a tier airline the journey started in the concorde lounge dubai and it is a very small area with little food that in the two hour i wa there wa not refreshed onboard the you begin to sense the job worth attitude of the staff who seem to permanently work to rule amazingly when the menu came it contained only an arabic snack with no option they say this is to allow maximum sleep no other airline ha done this breakfast wa undercooked slop and it wa inedible it is incredible that you can spend usd on a ticket and you can t even get a meal the airline is clearly failing fast and i wish now i had flown the luxury of emirate at half the price very disappointing and they don t care,positive

london gatwick to funchal in my opinion british airway have got thing badly wrong in the race to the bottom for traveller in economy ba are now just another budget carrier and not a very good one at that they have failed to understand what their true market is all about generally if people want to use a cheap budget carrier they will use the like of ryanair or easyjet the ba brand ha always been associated with the quality that a full service airline provides but sadly not any more the choice of food for sale to the economy passenger is not only poor but it s expensive frankly it must be embarrassing for the cabin crew to make announcement saying that the business class passenger will be offered a hot meal and free drink but all those in economy must pay and that assumes that from the enormous range of type of sandwich on offer that there will be any left on our flight to and from funchal there wa a single trolley for the entire economy cabin in each case taking more than hour to make it from the front to the back service could only have been any slower if the crew were trying to sell scratch card along with the overpriced food and drink maybe that s in the next part of the ba master plan british airway used to be a national carrier to be proud of but these day they are just an embarrassment not a full service airline or a decent budget carrier simply lost somewhere in the middle a a fairly regular traveller of many year my preference would always been to travel with my national airline but this race to the bottom is driving me away don t ba management understand that there are many people who would gladly pay a little bit more for free food and drink sadly i think we know the answer all we need now is a bugle playing a the plane touch down and the sad transition from world class carrier to poor budget imitator will be complete,negative

london city to dusseldorf return flight operated on behalf of ba by eastern airway the cabin wa clean on both aircraft and the check in and wait at the both the airport were reasonable however then the good part of the trip cease cabin crew must of been member of the basil fawlty school of catering the outward flight there were passenger in the business class cabin and the onboard menu wa handed out to the three of u the young stewardess took our order then we heard a crash a the young stewardess promptly dropped one of the meal and told u that the aircraft only had two meal and asked for a volunteer to give up their meal the meal wa of a reasonable quality and well presented on arrival at dusseldorf the aircraft wa parked at a remote stand and we were taken by bus to the wrong terminal the arrival board in the airport say terminal b and we were dropped off at terminal c our delivered to terminal c and we had to walk to terminal b if you were been met the return flight wa another example of the sub standard ground handling agent that ba is becoming famous for at overseas airport check in did not open until minute before the fight to lcy and hour before the flight to lhr i can see that this wa a money saving wiz by the ground handling agent at dusseldorf a the flight to lcy may only have max pax and they would of been able to see the flight loading the day before the check in staff were reasonable and two were very smart only to be let down by the young female on club europe who wa tattooed and had a slightly outlandish hairstyle which looked totally out of place in uniform the flight again seemed to have catering problem in business class with pax and only meal which meant that passenger were offered a so called ham chasse croissant which looked if it had seen better day again the cabin crew fell below the standard expect on budget airline such ha wizz and ryanair in fact they have better staff than eastern airway so these crew maybe the one who have failed these airline selection process i wa disgusted with the lack of professionism and customer service skill these crew displayed on arrival at lcy it become apparent that the ground handling agent at dusseldorf had failed to load all the bag for the flight and left somewhere in the region of passenger case behind the handling agent at lcy could not be bothered to take a proactive approach to ensure the bag followed on the next flight i did phone on monday evening and a gave more detail of the content of the case to them which they did update on the system this morning i spoke to a member of senior management at dussledorf airport about hour after this call the bag had been found in the baggage handling area at the airport they will be put on the late flight tonight which mean i will get it nearly day after it became missed it is a pity that we cant review the ground handling agent at airport a no they would have to have to let negative result be posted,negative
what is happening to british airway flew vancouver to london the a ha to be my favorite long haul aircraft but ba is definitely not cabin crew were friendly and professional despite not being a full complement of crew several dish were crossed off the menu apparently due to ongoing dispute why food wa inedible the worst i have ever been served on a business flight the seat configuration is outdated blanket threadbare and pancake thin pillow the constant cost cutting by their management is now laid bare for all to see they need to spend some time on a singapore airline aircraft to see what business class really is ba s golden year are well and truly over it will take a miracle to bring them back,positive

athens to london with british airway to call this business class is some sort of mean spirited joke to start with british airway lounge is provided by skyway which a jammed with both people and a bad assortment of food the actual seat d had no power plug and no tv at the front of the seat what you find in economy in canada the seat width wa narrow and the pitch wa pathetic flying premium economy on cathay pacific is dramatically superior the flight from heathrow to athens wa on a very beat up b on aug the food on this flight wa both minuscule and horrid it is amazing that they can attempt to call this level of service business very disappointing,negative

london to chicago i am a ba gold member and reserved three ba business class ticket to chicago returning from denver i selected contiguous seat so that my young daughter and myself would sit together a week before departure i received a message from ba informing me that our flight wa cancelled and that we were moved to an earlier flight on the same day on the departure date we checked smoothly at the business class counter at lhr the fast track boarding pas reader let u through without a problem the lounge attendant however curtly dismissed u a having economy class boarding pass i checked and it wa true but i had not suspected it at all till that point since i had paid for business class believed that everything wa in order and wa not told otherwise at check in the customer service agent at the lounge told me that there wa nothing he could do since it wasn t him who downgraded the ticket i spoke to the manager who apologized and tried to search for seat on subsequent flight but they were all full he could not confirm if ba had any intention of compensating u for the downgrade he had no explanation for why ba did not give u any other option with business seat despite canceling the flight a week in advance nor did he acknowledge that ba had made any mistake in this ordeal however he did contact the crew and informed them of the situation we ended up traveling in economy class to add insult to injury the airline wa unable to place u next to each other so the family wa split seven row apart however the crew wa nice and allowed u to leave the aircraft first they almost seem to work for a different company when compared to the incompetent ground staff,negative
nice to london heathrow i had to fly to nice and back for work booked through the company travel agency extra bag added both way i wanted to fly back to lhr earlier so my travel agent rebooked the earlier flight at a cost of gbp when i arrived at nce the ground staff refused to acknowledge the extra bag saying that it wa for the earlier flight i stood my ground but the head of check in told me if i wanted to fly i had to pay eur which i did under duress i had prebooked my seat a silver to find out at the gate that it had been changed to a middle seat which i loathe a the is claustrophobic i asked for my bag to be offloaded and i would travel on the next flight a is my right to do so there wa a standoff at the gate the trend for ba in their spiral to the bottom is to outsource check in staff who have no comprehension of the ba system combined with an arrogant ignorance that mean i will not be choosing this airline again i have one more flight with them next week and that s it i paid almost pound to get to nice and back today in economy i wa greeted with disdain by ground staff the crew on board were utterly miserable a they get to grip with the fact that they are now a junk airline who despite the high price have the audacity to charge pound for a gin and tonic aircraft are tired and worn toilet stink please do yourself a favour and book someone else,negative
london to doha my flight got cancelled due to cabin crew strike i had no choice but to fly on this day due to work commitment the class i had booked wa not available on the alternative qatar airway flight and british airway refused to upgrade me so they could only downgrade to economy i would rate british airway way below the normal standard of customer satisfaction,positive

unimpressed service very indifferent impression that it s only a job by flight crew with no smile on this flight perfunctory service at best guess this maybe all you can expect when you fly economy british airway call their economy world traveller i wonder if those at the top making decision have travelled the world and are aware of the much superior service most other airline offer even in economy ba take a page from qantas to see what economy service look like my understanding is ba recently lost a star and are now only star quite understandable from what wa offered on this flight food awful dinner of chicken rice and pea breakfast over ireland wa a cream filled bun and granola bar awful even a recent united flight from syd to sfo served better meal no return of crew to offer more beverage and no service of water during the flight which most airline constantly offer the wine offering wa the best part a reasonably good spanish pinot gris there are alternative to the uk from canada air canada air transat westjet on westjet you purchase your food but i m sure it ha to be superior to ba s offering my last flight to britain on air canada wa much superior air france last october to paris wa excellent qantas to australia is always brilliant the only redeeming factor on this flight wa the airbus still the smoothest and quietest plane flying apparently british airway ceo is an accountant and the bean counting show in the service and food quality offered service on my flight wa budget airline service at best and should be an embarrassment to britain s flag carrier,positive
british aurways wa once one of the best airline in the world well known for outstanding inflight service decent food comfortable seat good entertainment and a level of professionalism unequalled by many other airline how time have changed under recent ceo most notably the current holder the post alex cruz ba ha declined to the level of a budget airline in fact i ve had superior travel experience on some budget carrier flying from vancouver to london on the a wa superb it s a wonderful aircraft beyond that atrocious dinner wa a tough piece of chicken over cooked vegetable and dried up rice breakfast wa a farce a dry bun with a smearing of cream cheese and a granola bar hardly suitable breakfast fare the entertainment option were far inferior to what they used to be and the crew were unsmiling disinterested and inattentive throughout the flight no snack no water offering between meal nothing on the same route air canada is superior in every way it s very sad that such an excellent airline is in the hand of a ceo who s strategy seems to be a race to the bottom rather than a quest to be among the best of airline,positive
british airway is quickly becoming a low quality low cost service but premium priced airline apart from removing food from their service and replacing it with mark spencer buy on board menu on that particular flight they even managed to run out of food for those who were willing to pay it wa impressive to see so many passenger having and expressing the same opinion next time we ll just fly another airline that reflects that quality of service into the ticket price this came only a month after the major it failure that grounded all ba flight for a weekend the only thing they have left is safety if they lose that then it s over,negative
catania to gatwick about min after the plane took off the food trolley wa wheeled up to the club class curtain and staff man had the task of selling all the leftover from the outbound flight it took hour for the trolley to reach row our row there wa no food left not even a kit kat we had the last can of coca cola and a bottle of water several factor contributed to this silly situation ba trying to become a low cost airline i did not realise that it had sunk so low when i booked the fact that only some card transaction could be used to pay the blocking of the aisle for long period resulted in the trolley spending more time being pushed up and down the aisle to let passenger get to the loo and back than it did selling ba trying to keep the front toilet for business class passenger totally inadequate supply of food on board the aircraft this meant the sale person had to go through what wa left with every sale in the hope of finding something that the passenger would accept,negative
venice to gatwick problem encountered on th july at venice marco polo airport a a result of cancellation of flight ba back to gatwick from various conversation that took place it would appear that there were no british airway staff at venice marco polo airport everything is handled by the local service agent obviously many of the problem are a a result of mishandling by the local service agent they need to be made aware and re trained if necessary a no doubt ba are paying them money to carry out their duty announcement were unclear especially in the lounge the departure board information did not help after arriving at we were eventually taken by bus to a hotel almost hour away arriving at the following day on the replacement flight we were taxiing out and a flight deck hold warning light came on creating further delay while that wa fixed i am all for safe flying but ba need to improve their standard,negative

gatwick to orlando return possibly the worst pre and post flight experience i can remember hr late on the way out almost three hour late on the return journey ba use of old aircraft is to blame a failed ife that couldn t be repaired took two hour to try and remedy after this failed a replacement plane wa required by the time this arrived ba realised their crew could not fly due to exceeding their hour this led to a further hr delay waiting for a standby crew this wa avoidable and show the lack of genuine care pre flight by ba no refreshment provided no accurate information just endless waiting they didn t board the child first and it wa a total mess the plane could not land due to bad weather and had to divert to tampa due to low fuel whilst this seems fair enough the plane wa actually hr late leaving gatwick in the first place so had it left on time it might have landed fine and passenger would not have encountered a long a delay a we did a terrible shame and an embarrassment to be called british a it doe not bring any warm or professional feeling a far a i can see i will not be using ba again,negative
san diego to london heathrow the worst business class i have flown in i flew on the so whilst it s not the newest plane in the fleet i still expected some level of comfort the seat are too narrow and do not lie flat i m a slim size and could not turn around in my seat there is a footrest that come down to form the end of the bed but doe not line up with the rest of the seat so your foot are raised the armrest are narrow and hard and wobble around every time the person next to you move your chair move too the hydraulics must be connected it wa very annoying the tray table wa not well supported and when pulled out of the arm rest it sloped down and so drink meal tray did not stay put it wa not secure and basically wa flimsy and unusable i had to use my inflatable neck pillow to support it on my lap i wa in seat a which wa a rear facing window seat there is a plastic divider between you and the seat next to you which is a forward facing aisle seat the divider ha to stay down until you are airbourne so for the first minute or so whilst the plane is boarding you are staring a fellow passenger directly in the face very awkward the tv pull out of the side column and mine wouldn t stay put it wanted to go back into the column and so i had to watch my movie at an angle the food well the fillet streak wa tough and dry i had a similar dish flying out to the state on a with american airline and they did a much better job the selection of wine wa good and the key lime pie wa nice service if you want good service don t get a window seat you are cut off from the aisle and with the plastic divider up between you and the opposite passenger the cabin crew forget you are even there i had to ask for a drink when the trolley went round both with dinner and breakfast the layout of the seat also make it tricky for the cabin crew to pas you your drink and food a they have go above the opposite passenger head not ideal with some turbulence there wa also no wifi even though ba advertise a such apparently the boeing doe not have the right equipment in short ba have obviously prioritised cramming a many small seat a possible into business class cabin the layout is impractical seat are narrow there is an awkwardness with an intimate view of the fellow passenger and the layout also mean that your not clearly visible to the cabin crew and so get ignored the is an old plane and definitely need modernising to ensure that the seat are working properly the tv s stay out of their socket so you can watch a movie and the tray table can support your meal i for one will not be flying ba business again,negative

london heathrow to brussels return through work i have to fly frequently and am firmly of the opinion that a ba flight is to be endured rather than enjoyed even in the premium cabin if your timing is right the price reflect this that is before the add on s so be prepared to get on last be prepared to be given the middle seat on the last or second to last row and eat and drink before you board unless of course you are happy to pay more that way if you get an aisle seat or are allocated the third to last row up it s a win any flight longer than a couple of hour i strenuously avoid ba if i can a shame because in some way i grew up with ba back in the day of boac and bea having said that the flight to and from brussels were ok in a full aircraft either way,positive
london heathrow to accra flight left nearly two hour late bit of an explanation but wa really because the ground staff boarded the plane with only minimal time to departure this is always a busy flight with passenger taking on load of cabin bag ground staff only started to collect excess baggage from people with min to boarding and so there wa no room on board for all luggage chaos in economy class on this flight it doe not work when the flight is boarded with anything less than hr to departure when will ba realise this flight need at least min to board it is the most delayed flight out of heathrow because of this poor management fact the ground staff did nothing to control the crowd simple and polite request would have helped the grand staff were downright rude and grumpy with their passenger on one of the money making flight for the airline they need to up their game and just be polite even if they do not enjoy their job or dealing with passenger once on board the crew were friendly and professional very friendly but this doe make up for old aircraft in need of a good clean and refresh along with poor in flight entertainment poor food and very poor quality seat the cold salad option are far better than the hot offering in ba s club class still no wi fi on ba even discount carrier like norwegian have this now let along the flag carrier like emirate and qatar airway,negative
krakow to london got u there fine my main issue is the food service i wa sat in row probably of the way back it wa an evening weekday flight so everyone tired hungry their new m s service wa a disaster the flight wa just over hour it took hour for the single food trolley to make it way to my row by the time it arrived all that wa available wa a kitkat and some other sweet they had already run out of sandwich hot food it took a long time because each customer had to pay using credit card and the machine seemed to keep on having problem also the variety on the new m s menu whilst generally a good thing meant the staff kept on running back to the galley to replenish clearly still not enough stored have to say this service is no better than easyjet i will think twice about travelling with ba if it wasn t paid for by work i would not have travelled with them the service ha gone downhill over the year which is a real shame for a national carrier,positive

venice to gatwick i am done with british airway it ha the worst service and incredibly rude staff we were supposed to fly back from venice at p m on th july the flight wa delayed by an hour and a half ba policy indicates that there will be no food voucher or otherwise for flight delay of less than two hour fair enough however what this doe not take into account is the timing of the flight or the airport the only cafe at the vce airport available to customer after security wa shutting at around pm when i went to buy some water the guy at the counter refused outright another lady had been there since am her flight earlier that day wa delayed and she went around the same time to redeem her food voucher the guy shouted at her and called a guard on duty who wa of no help and wa incredibly rude my partner tweeted about this to ba and there wa no response from them at all although they were complimenting on someone s pic at the same time we finally found a vending machine and there wa no water there too there wa not one person from british airway this whole time till am in the morning a if this wasn t enough when boarding started and we were showing our ticket we were told that that wa the priority boarding line and the one next to u wa for regular joes like u we were the tenth twelfth people from the front in the queue and the other queue wa moving parallel to u there wa no sign or announcement separating the two queue instead of politely mentioning that this member of ba staff shout at u for everyone to hear and asks u to go to the back of the line by then the so called priority boarding wa over so both the queue were meant for everyone when i mentioned this she told me that i wa cutting the queue and wasting her time we just moved aside and waited for everyone else to board before we did i am definitely never going to choose ba again,negative

naples to gatwick i used to admire and love ba i now no longer admire it but dislike it and am soon likely to hate it i think that one is entitled to have pleasant expectation when paying the not inconsiderable supplement for flying club europe my wife and i have noticed a constant deterioration over the last two year have complained and received some avios in compensation but this time the cup overfloweth unfortunately not with blessing we had once again been allocated aisle seat in separate row even though my wife s preference state that she like a window seat and there were plenty of seat adjacent to each other available when we were permitted to make online change so we did manage to get seat next to each other but why doe ba have to keep doing this the trip a such started well enough in the new ba south terminal lounge which wa spacious and had a good selection of drink food and magazine when time came for boarding and amongst others club europe passenger were invited to board first there wa no check made at all which resulted in an almighty scrum a just anybody pushed forward immediately exacerbated by then having to stand cooped up in the stifling bridge for over minute a the cleaning of the aircraft had not finished once boarded we were unlike the other club europe passenger not offered a glass of water but worst of all and unforgivable found food debris and other dirt in between our seat so much for having to wait for the cleaning to be finished when i opened my meal tray it clearly had not been cleaned a there were crumb and stain on it we took photograph and also pointed our finding out to the very pleasant stewardess who seemed utterly appalled when she looked the meal wa pleasant but we were not offered coffee or tea afterwards and whilst i do not object to being served wine from a large bottle it mean one get only a smallish glassful so ha to ask for a refill something not everybody like to do this practice of pouring from a large bottle is clearly a cost cutting exercise on previous occasion we had been disappointed to find that no lounge facility for club europe passenger are available in airport like corfu rhodes heraklion even seville contrary to ba s website at the time we were told at all these airport ba no longer pay for it passenger to have access so this time my wife enquired well in advance whether we would have lounge access in naples she wa told no but at least we knew beforehand or so we thought but when we got the holding area prior to the gate opening we were joined by some rather merry club europe passenger who told u that there wa a lounge though not exclusively for ba use that they had been able to access and enjoy why could the check in staff not have told u the waiting area did not have sufficient seat but we were lucky and found some however when a young lady arrived to deal with checking boarding card passenger who were sitting beyond where she stood were forced to get up and move all the way back to the other side club europe passenger were amongst the first to be called so that did not look too bad know what we showed our boarding pas then had to stand no seat available in a very cramped area for minute before the gate wa opened in other word we had the doubtful privilege of having to stand for longer than other passenger,positive

gatwick to mauritius very disappointed to see the decline in quality from ba since i last flew with them for a flight of hour to mauritius i wa shocked by the quality of the economy class seat and that ba seriously consider them good enough for a long haul flight of this length possibly the least comfortable airline seat i ve ever had with every lump and bump imaginable and the infuriating headrest which doesn t stay up slipping down and banging you in the neck every minute the seat back offered no protection from the person behind putting thing in their seat pocket legroom also very poor albeit i am above average height but my knee were pressed against the seat in front even before they reclined into me the food wa also poor no snack offered and the meal were slop i have flown air nz virgin emirate and ba in the last two year and ba wa the poorest in term of food and comfort good point the cabin crew were reasonably good toilet were clean and the in flight entertainment worked fine with a good selection but that wasn t enough to save this from being a genuinely poor experience,positive

london heathrow to larnaca british airway wa once the flagship airline of the uk you paid a little bit more but the service wa always a cut above the rest now they have decided to turn it into a budget airline where you have to pay extra for everything including the highly priced sandwich they even charge for water and if you don t have a card in your pocket you have to go without a they don t take cash i did not mind paying that bit extra for ba flight but now better off with easyjet,positive
london to hong kong in premium economy i have been flying ba on my many trip over the last six year and i have seen such a shocking decline in their service that i feel compelled to write this review of my six flight this year three were seriously delayed one wa from oslo to london on th june when the captain decided to wait for some business class passenger who hadn t made their way out of the lounge in time for take off my worst experience however wa going to hong kong on th may when there wa a technical fault with the plane the captain decided to board passenger at the scheduled time who then sat on the plane for almost three hour without being offered any water or other refreshment and with little information and apology before an hour flight i wa in premium economy but the extra amount i paid did not offer any additional comfort i switched my seat to help a disabled passenger and ended up in a seat next to the toilet which meant that i got no rest during the night how can premium economy seat be next to the toilet the in flight service wa poor a nobody came around to offer water or beverage during the night i am still wondering why anybody would pay for premium economy a it is just a lousy offer seat are only marginally more spacious than in economy but don t recline a they would in economy the food is the same which mean rather bad and the flight attendant are clearly not interested in offering service beyond the first two hour of the flight predictably the plane landed in hong kong just in time below three hour delay for the airline avoiding to have to pay compensation to passenger on this very uncomfortable flight i had hoped to have a better experience on the return flight on th june but then i found out that ba had scrapped the sparkling wine a a welcome drink for premium economy passenger although this time the flight wa on time this gave me such a bad feeling about ba their cynical attitude towards their passenger and their meanness i will look for alternative airline from now on and would recommend to avoid flying with ba,negative

chennai to london what a mistake i selected this route for a two reason i wanted to try the new british airway in club class and the timing but i have nothing good to say about the whole thing the lounge at chennai wa poor but at least it wa near the gate once aboard the plane we discovered that instead of what i think should be standard in business class there is no direct aisle access for the window seat and if you re in the aisle seat you ll have people climbing over your leg to access the aisle and the hostess leaning over you to serve the person in the window seat the layout is quite crazy the seat themselves are fairly standard business class arrangement but it how ba have crammed them all in that s the issue i had the window seat and initially i found it ok but a it wa a very long all daytime flight i had to dim the window and that s the point you can only dim them down there is no blind the sun still shine through ok i accept it s like looking through very dark sun glass but it s not possible to cut out the light a you get with blind i understand several other airline are retro fitting blind on the but this is a major error by boeing it wa my second flight on a both were hour plus flight the earlier one i made wa at night so no issue with the window blind i ve not noticed any advantage in the higher pressure of the aircraft i find myself just a tired after a flight a i would be on any other aircraft i m a long term supporter of ba and i m so upset that ba are going backwards focusing on profit and ripping off the customer sorry ba but there are so many good airline out there competing for your business please wake up and start delivering service to customer not just cram them in and take the money because it won t last people like me will move on,negative
flew london gatwick to genoa with british airway fast check in at the smart new premium area at gatwick brand new lounge wa really comfortable and with a great selection of food drink and magazine access to the lounge not very convenient but given the design of the terminal i realize that nothing can be done about that the gate number wa only announced minute prior to the gate closing and it wa minute away at at fast pace especially a there wa a queue to exit the lounge by the two elevator on board our club europe seat that we had paid extra to choose something that no other airline that i know of doe with a full business class fare wa behind the curtain overhead bin were full so ourselves and another club europe passenger had to put their bag further back in the economy cabin without assistance an engineer wa called to try to move the divider and curtain back but it wa stuck and remained between row and with our seat being in row my special meal wa not on board however the crew member in the premium cabin wa very obliging and a crew meal wa provided for the short flight leg room wa atrocious for business class and seat are the same a economy because the curtain could not be drawn the business class toilet wa used by economy class passenger and at time business passenger had to queue behind them given the high expectation following the experience on the ground the plane wa not up to standard however the service provided despite these lapse wa great had to wait for about minute for bag despite being the only aircraft at genoa airport in all this wa not a business class quality flight we should have flown economy for a quarter of the price,positive
flew british airway from beijing to london heathrow the cabin crew did their best but they know they are now providing a very inferior product compared to other carrier cut back are evident everywhere from the small and very cheap hot towel offered only once during the ten hour flight and the nut presented in a packet other than with other airline on china and warm this might seem a small niggle but it is indication of ba save cost by annoying their premium cabin customer the amenity kit presented in a shoe bag is a joke really to be honest one get a better premium cabin product from other one world member royal jordanian and qatar for example flight left and arrived on time but the airline should be more than that the offering within the flight need to be competitive and regain some ground wa presented at the second meal serice with frozen pawn on bread returned and a de frosted plate came by return unsure if prawn being frozen and unfrozen a a good idea but no effect a yet part of the seat wa covered with food from the previous flight i covered it up with a spare blanket despite there being enough toilet for club world passenger there wa often a line of people waiting from world traveller plus snaking past seat in row and no control of passenger from world traveller plus coming in to the club world cabin toilet were not cleaned through the flight by crew twice they were in a bit of state so i ended up cleaning the floor with tissue myself lovely shame to see one of the great carrier fall to such low level,positive
flew british airway from corfu to london heathrow food service a joke i have never written a review on anything in my life but how can an airline like british airway spend probably million of pound setting up a new food paying service by using an antiquated system of the poor cabin staff needing to find each individual item picture on the hand held computer and check they have entered the correct number of item instead of using barcodes unbelievable if the company ha become so badly managed how many quango to come up with this decision that common sense is lost in corporate nonsense apart from that flight great but sorry ba please admit your mistake and put this right,positive
heathrow to santorini we were at the gate when ba cancelled our flight we could not get booked on another flight and we got told to go home without our luggage it took them day to return it ba will not reimburse u the cost of the flight at or the cost of the hotel at this is a total disgrace how can they be allowed to do that book with another airline to ensure you actually arrive never experienced such bad customer service and refusing to refund our money is outrageous,negative

we flew out of terminal on saturday with british airway to brussels and found everyone to be very helpful and friendly we even had a nice chat with a pilot a we went up in the lift to departure we got the feeling that people were very anxious to put the disastrous previous day behind them we used the lounge a we have a silver card and they were busy but well staffed and the food wa good on the aircraft we took our own home made sandwich since we really didn t fancy the mark and spencer price i bought a bottle of water close to our gate and thought that wa expensive enough but the ba on board water wa per bottle i did notice that the flight attendant were very good at giving out small glass of free water like many i can t get used to this budget airway approach it s clearly embarrassing the staff who are very good on our return we had big delay due to the storm in southern england and air traffic restriction then we had brussels air traffic delay due to their system failure at all time the first officer kept u well informed and we got back to london and were parked on a good jetty so that we could rush to catch up this delay wa not ba s fault and the cabin crew on both flight were friendly and efficient i enjoyed the flight but hope that ba do not make any further cut and perhaps think about restoring free food and beverage again one day,positive
british airway seems to be going from bad to worse on my london heathrow to lisbon flight the card machine didn t accept american credit card so the gentleman next to me couldn t pay for his drink the length of time it took the flight attendant to reach the back of the plane meant most people weren t offered anything to eat or drink until minute to landing the flight attendant were very apologetic but you feel that they themselves are fed up and seem genuinely embarrassed to be working for ba return flight wa delayed by min which seems to be a running theme with this airline they are no better than the budget airline but with anything other than budget price,negative
booked gatwick to lima return out world traveller premium economy which wa not too bad return club world wa appalling seat and surround grubby equipment maintenance poor service wa appalling staff rushed almost shouted at when asking what we wanted expected u to know how to operate equipment food thrust at u not served everything rushed no politeness in service drink choice not outlined just what do you want if it were not for the flat bed overnight it is a total waste of money it is so sad that ba is going to the dog a business is nothing without customer and ba are doing a great job at alienating them i will not fly ba long haul again,negative
london to johannesburg after getting caught up in the chaos of the bank holiday weekend it fiasco and the lamentable way in which the situation wa handled by ba i approached my flight back to the uk with some trepidation my fear were not unfounded a the aircraft had been sitting at jnb for most of the day there were no delay and boarding started very early i wa seat a top deck double seat and the leg room wa no better than you would find on a ryanair flight to dublin indeed due to the location of the electronic equipment box under the seat it wa a little more cramped the service on ba flight really is terrible i along with many other passenger wa treated like an inconvenience and i felt the cabin crew would really have preferred it if we weren t there i wa close to the galley and sleep wa pretty much impossible due in part to the cabin crew gossiping loudly about other member of staff i will do everything i can to avoid flying ba in the future,negative
washington to sofia via london flying world traveller plus premium economy to london and eurotraveller economy on the short hop top quality service whatever may have declined in economy class premium economy is a good a ever with in leg room and meal really tasty in this instance that can be ordered in advance the cabin crew are still the ba strength creating a relaxed congenial atmosphere in the cabin smooth connection at terminal with no waiting either way and tribute cornish ale available on the long haul drink menu and service is a winner i ll admit the m s food drink service can be a bit time consuming a far a handling the payment but work ok otherwise british airway continue to deliver a first rate travel experience and i m sticking with them,positive

rome to heathrow having used ba business club for some time we always felt it wa the little extra treat to add to our holiday it s been a deteriorating service recently but the last trip to and from rome wa the decider the cabin wa filthy with litter and crumb from the previous flight on and around the seat no nut or nibble and the drink were dispensed from open bottle the miniature wine bottle apparently dispensed with now there wa a choice of meal but you weren t told unless you asked the meal service no sooner served than it wa being cleared away altogether we felt that we were an inconvenience to the smooth running of the airline the advantage of booking club have gone the lounge being dreadful with little choice of snack the priority label mean you bag come off last and you only get priority boarding if you scramble past the queue add to this that on occasion the boarding pas will fail at security it should not be allowed to carry our national flag,negative

chicago to london heathrow on british airway much vaunted sleeper service in business class be advised this service is a joke never mind the terrible dated seat facing one another but the ba sleeper service mandate you eat in their awful biz class lounge at ord and then suffer no dinner service on the plane this is a monumental con also imagine your worst school meal in a school cafeteria and that is what you get in the ba lounge at ord the food wa some kind of dreadful steamed slop that you literally would not feed your dog i used to imagine that long haul business and first class passenger were valued by trans atlantic airline the british airway business class product is the worst by far old aircraft old seat disillusioned crew and simply the most terrible food imaginable british airway hold their premium class passenger in contempt what happened to english class and manner,negative
gatwick to funchal british airway ha won the race to the bottom leg room on this flight wa appalling worse than ryanair i can understand why no free food on short hop but this flight wa four hour i wonder just what we gained from a full service airline our previous british airway flight wa on a gatwick they are adding an extra seat to these plane with the recent it debacle they have reached the bottom and don t need to do anything else,positive
i am shocked about how the first class on board service ha deteriorated with very evident cost cutting on what is supposed to be our national flag carrier on our flight to tokyo narita from london heathrow we were advised by the cabin crew soon after take off that the catering supply loaded were limited to cut a long story short this meant that my partner who wa the last to be served wa told what wa available rather than asked what he would like this is in spite of there being only passenger in the seat cabin for breakfast prior to landing we were informed that only two cooked breakfast were available so it would be first come first served the presentation of the food that wa available wa poor certainly not worthy of the fine dining description ba us for it first class catering we spoke to the cabin service manager who wa extremely apologetic confirmed that there ha been cost cutting apparently at the behest of the new ceo who come from low cost sister airline vueling with a resultant increase in unhappiness complaint from passenger the famous first class tasting menu we enjoyed on previous flight is now gone other cost cutting around on board service is very evident even the rose in the first class toilet wa dead which really epitomises the lacklustre airline that ba ha become i fly regularly long haul with klm their new business class offering is now far superior to ba s first how can our national airline with whom we should be proud to fly compete with other superior european gulf carrier when the emphasis seems to be only on never ending cost cutting that now affect even the most premium passenger the cabin service manager entered a formal complaint on our behalf from on board on may almost a month later although immediately acknowledged ba have not responded probably due to more administrative cost cutting i should add that the ground service at heathrow t the concorde room were very good but a regard on board service ba offends their premium passenger like this at their peril,negative
absolute cheapskate business class flight in club europe from luxembourg to london heathrow is beyond a joke and clearly on a shoe string budget no pre meal drink offered limited selection of drink with wine served in plastic screw top mini bottle warm with no nut nibble meal selection consisted of a chicken salad prawn which looked reasonably nice however i m allergic to seafood or a toasted cheese roll the roll wa dry tasteless and completely unsatisfactory could have easily bought something better at greggs crew could clearly be heard bad mouthing their ceo over the airline recent it problem friendly crew though can t help but feel sorry for them,positive

choose a budget airline the magic of our national carrier ha gone we have always chosen british airway a our preferred carrier where possible and happy to pay a higher premium for the once great service but now it s on par or lower than other low cost carrier firstly we didn t get any priority boarding with our two young child easyjet provides this secondly we reserved seat a travelling with our two child they both fight for who is going to sit at the window on boarding we were told the plane ha changed therefore we now had assigned seat thirdly after paying over for two small alcoholic drink for me and my wife i needed the loo first class wa out of bound so the only option the rear of the plane however the crew were busy serving and not prepared to move to allow me past i guess those drink they were selling had the ba executive team seeing many so me being a customer needing the loo wa second in priority after a long period they moved to the rear to allow me past but once out they had gone back to the middle of the plane a crew member at the back galley even laughed and said your not getting back and therefore fairly offered me a free cup of tea our flight from heathrow to bergen wa only an hour and but i spent the majority in the rear galley chatting with the said crew member the return flight the cabin crew had a much enthusiasm a my year old grandmother and technology the safety briefing came over a tannoy that would have sounded half decent in and to top it off the lead steward whilst taxiing for takeof asked the crew cabin crew seat for landing the captain gave u an update on takeoff and then radio silence for the rest of the flight even upon landing he stood at the front having a chat with the said steward a we disembarked about how some machine must have come to life with that landing all minor point but they were the point we enjoyed with ba point that made u choose them small point that made the difference the pilot at the end of the flight welcoming or thanking the customer and u thanking them the cabin crew that always went over and beyond the free drink that made u feel special to ask and get i d rather pay a premium for all that or choose a budget airline gutted our british airway national carrier ha become a budget airline perhaps cost saving are needed but for now although we are a minor factor and small fry in the bigger picture they need to cost save some more to make up our future ticket and my recommendation are now also dead for me their usp wa their service without that there is no longer a point,positive
london heathrow to seoul return i booked my return flight back in january when ba were having their annual sale for around thought this wa a bargain a they are usually up around london to seoul flight wa very pleasant didn t get to use the business class lounge in heathrow a my connection from manchester wa delayed by minute cabin crew on the actual flight were excellent and very attentive food and drink wa what you would expect of most business class airline with a decent amount of high quality menu choice the seat layout of with seat facing in the opposite direction to each other and a divider between them felt a little bit cramped the seat were very comfortable and went flat which is better than some however there is a fold down seat step in front of you that you have to use to able to stretch out fully i m and found i wa at my limit of being able to stretch out fully so anyone taller than that would probably be a bit uncomfortable inflight entertainment had a decent range of tv and film to choose from including some of the more recent release toilet were also smaller and more cramped than on other airline that i ve flown business class with before the only let down wa that the cabin itself wa hotter than the sun and i found it difficult to sleep because of this seoul to london wa what really let ba down for me and left a sour note on what wa an amazing month in korea in the day leading up to the flight ba s massive it failure and the lack of information and help surrounding it meant i wa having to frantically check if my flight would be leaving at all with the flight on the th and th being cancelled completely luckily they got it sorted in the early hour of the morning on the day of the flight the flight and cabin crew arrived late for the flight and so take off wa delayed by minute i had a connecting flight to catch to manchester so it wa imperative that everything went smoothly a i had just over an hour after landing to make it the flight wa lovely with the cabin crew doing an amazing job the pilot managed to make up for lost time and so we ended up landing minute earlier than scheduled however due to the backlog of delayed and cancelled flight from the past couple of day there wa another flight in the space where mine wa supposed to park this meant a delay of minute while we waited on the tarmac for the space to become free this wa time i could not afford to lose we eventually disembarked at which meant i had to sprint through the airport to passport control and to the baggage reclaim really wish i hadn t a it still took minute for the bag to come off the plane by the time i had done all this and gone through arrival it wa and the gate wa closing in min talked to ba customer service and got rebooked on another flight back to the iom where i live from london city but they could only book me on the pm flight the next day wasn t at all happy with the experience overall because of this and for what you would normally pay over when not on sale it really wasn t worth the hassle for me personally,positive

gatwick to lima return in business class no choice of seat until hr before the flight unless you paid extra i understand their desire to reward frequent flyer but paying pp per flight if you aren t is just a huge irritation factor when you have already forked out so much for biz by the time we were able to check in there wa only one option left if we wanted to sit together new ba lounge at lgw smart but packed out at the start of easter holiday limited food offering at breakfast no hot food at all unless you count lukewarm pastry fa service on flight in both direction wa good though outbound the cabin light were switched off for the entire flight between meal service despite it being a day flight food and drink were fine but nothing special some choice not available by the time they got to u seating layout of in business class is very cramped especially if the flight is full the highest density seating i ve ever experienced in business and there wa no surface to put anything on unless you had your tray table open small drawer at your foot recommend the window seat next to the bulkhead if you re travelling solo no leg to climb over lie flat seat wa comfortable though for a short person ife wa poor compared to competitor hard to angle the screen appropriately with a limited choice of movie available on the way home we didn t mind a long layover at lim a we thought we could use the lounge no such luck we couldn t be checked in all the way through from lpb so had to pick up luggage go through immigration again and wait several hour in a hot airport with hardly any seat before ba staff appeared to check in the flight home only seat choice available again were two together on the aisle side of a middle pair very fortunate not to have anyone in the other middle seat next to me otherwise it would have felt very intimate with a total stranger haven t travelled long haul with ba for several year and can only describe it a a functional value service even in business though it s not cheap i d only use ba again if they were the most convenient by a long way a happened here for a direct flight from london or for a great price on short haul there s really no comparison to emirate long haul offering in business,positive
london heathrow to santorini we flew with of our family to santorini the business class seat are a joke i am but i just could not move in the seat they are so tight we then learnt from the steward that it s a new configuration that hasn t gone down very well with customer this once great airline that s gone from the best to the worst in year and on european route it s no more than a budget carrier money is the key driver for ba with customer very last on the list we all felt we had paid for a service we never received,positive
london heathrow to bilbao i fly british airway a fair amount mainly for pleasure but recently they are beginning to slip my last flight wa with two friend for our annual outing this year to bilbao cannot fault the staff or flight crew however the cancellation of free on board food for short haul is stupid there is now no reason to use ba for short haul when there is a low cost alternative this cost cutting may well back fire probably initiated by the same imbecile who caused the computer outsourcing problem recently,negative
madeira to london i wa always of the belief that british airway provided a better standard of economy class travel but i realise now that they are no better than budget airline in fact i have experienced far better service on easyjet we waited over hour to be offered a drink and i ordered mark spencer heated focaccia which had clearly been in the oven for hour on top of that there were just toilet for people while business class customer enjoyed toilet between of them of course we also had to queue behind the serving trolley to get to the toilet so you can imagine how long that took they make it very clear that economy class is just that but it shame the price doesn t match the standard of service all in all a very disappointing experience and i will certainly think twice about choosing ba in future,positive
edinburgh to gatwick booked the ticket on the last minute due to missed train and tight schedule this wa my first time flying with ba and probably my last if i have other option it didn t feel like a national carrier felt more like budget airline with no snack drink and fare class that doesn t include checked baggage flight wa smooth enough efficient but boarded min late in edinburgh no service whatsoever served during the flight unless you pay an additional fee,negative

london heathrow to brussels disappointed by the non existent service onboard this flight regardless of how short the flight may well be you expect some sort of refreshment snack to be provided given this isn t a low carrier airline however ba have hit rock bottom in that they charge premium rate but give low carrier service certainly on short haul flight,negative

on this route from amsterdam to tokyo haneda via london heathrow we had the expected service onboard the first flight wa slightly delayed but our transfer time wa more then hour so that didn t cost any problem the cabin crew did their best to statisfy every passenger at the flight to hnd when we got our luggage we discovered that one of the suitcase wa damaged at hnd japan airline is the agent for british airway and a it cost time to explain everything their service wa great they filed a report to ba and when we are back from the journey we should contact ba to claim the damage we did and within a few day we got a really extensive response and were compensated despite this damaged suitcase it wa handled great that s what made the difference to me,positive
antigua to gatwick check in at the new terminal wa quick and efficient better than gatwick and although we had a slight delay at immigration we were soon airside the new lounge wa really comfortable and although we didn t use it it wa dark when we were there they have an excellent sky terrace with lounger and shaded sofa s etc the bar wa manned by helpful staff with a small but tasty selection of food boarding wa on time on board it wa soon evident that the interior of the plane had seen better day with my wife s tv nearly falling off it mounting fortunately she wa able to position it during the flight so that it stayed in place but it wa quite precarious push back and departure wa exactly on time within a short time the crew started the evening service and this is where it all seemed quite strange unlike the flight out where there wa a more relaxed atmosphere the crew seemed to feel there wa a need to rush whatever they were doing to the point that some of them were literally running down the aisle the food wa hurriedly delivered to u and wa disappointingly under seasoned and pretty tasteless i can only assume that the object of their haste wa to get everyone fed and watered and bedded down a quickly a possible to be quite honest i felt like we were being looked after by a nanny and told to go to bed early and i almost expected them to say i want you to go to sleep now and i don t want to here a sound out any of you until the morning now i know that the crew are all entitled to their break etc but at the end of the day or night they are working and are getting paid to do so in my opinion if they just slowed down a little and had more time for the passenger it would improve the flight considerably breakfast wa ok although i seemed to be the only person trying the bacon roll and after one mouthful i understood why in a blind tasting i probably would have guessed i wa eating rubber band we arrived on time and after quite a long walk to immigration and the baggage reclaim our case were waiting for u overall very disappointing and based on this flight i would not recommend ba,positive

i wa pleasantly surprised with british airway on both outbound and inbound flight from orlando to gatwick after reading the review i would go a far a to say i would choose them over virgin now unless there wa a dramatic price difference the crew both way were friendly and really helpful i have found virgin crew to be a bit up themselves thinking they are a cut above the rest contrary to how virgin crew are on an overnight flight serve food dim light and keep out the way until hour before landing ba crew still regularly came round making sure everyone wa ok and if anyone wanted anything we had nearly hour delay leaving orlando on g viiu firstly due to inbound being a bit late due to an alligator closing the runway and finally a medical issue on board whilst positioned on runway to go we returned to gate for paramedic top up of fuel etc and departed at versus throughout the crew were fantastic bringing drink round and keeping u all informed whilst the interior of the leisure fleet of is a bit on the tired side it wa still comfortable i can recommend d a there is no pax seat behind just a crew seat so no issue with being kneed in the back for economy class leg room wa good food wa fairly decent for aircraft food only slight negative wa the dated avod a it ha small screen and not a great deal of choice compared to more modern system,positive
london to hong kong the avios system is now a complete joke they are impossible to spend they release a minuscule number of flight and won t allow you to upgrade using them even when there is availability they ve just quoted me nearly to upgrade a flight this evening so i know there s availability but they won t let me use avios their concept of customer service is shocking and smack of an ex nationalised carrier more modern airline with easy to use air mile booking system like emirate deserve to be successful over this relic of an airline,positive

mexico city to copenhagen via london it appears inflight service ha improved a bit in club and the food is now edible and available in flight entertainment reminds one of the vhs day number of film available is rather limited timing with food wa great served quickly after take off and again late before arrival made time for a good rest configuration in club is not my favourite with reversed seat some crew choose to open the curtain every time the serve while other serve in front of you which will give you a better feeling of a private space best thing about ba is that it cheap and you can have the dorset crab for lunch at fornum and mason in terminal ba refuse to credit qatar airway avios even when qatar airway in writing ha confirmed they should be credited showing one level on my online profile right now and anotheron my ticket i have given up on avios,positive
london to santiago de chile surprisingly pleasing flight onboard boeing decided to give it a try to a rear facing business class window seat and discovered the b is or look far lighter and wider than any b i ve been travelling on could be larger window or the fuselage shape which make the cocoon look less cramped even the seat look wider while the ife screen is wider with a higher resolution the odd ying yang layout is slightly better on boeing a the central row do not have the honeymoon seat therefore you won t share such a narrow space with a stranger in case you end up there so first impression better than usual unfortunately the soft product remains way below par i pre ordered the main dish of the meal which this time wa actually available but the beef wa overcooked and chewy i will never stop mentioning that the amenity kit is simply ridiculous sort of a blue shoe bag too small to fit shoe though the crew very friendly but slightly less attentive than usual overall the experience wa better than usual mainly thanks to a newer quieter aircraft but ba is not improving where they should in those detail that make business class something worth eur spent still no wi fi on ba not commenting the ying yang layout which remains a mystery to me who approved such a nonsense,positive
gatwick to amsterdam a a regular flyer with ba my experience is that they have some of the best pilot and their inflight staff make all the effort to give the airline an image beyond that they have some of the worst airport desk staff in the industry they have no solution for the slightest problem we were scheduled to fly to amsterdam on the st of feb at there wa a radar problem in amsterdam easyjet etc were informing their customer of development nobody informed anyone at the ba desk until it became a confusion at almost we were rescheduled to the flight with another further hour delay before this i have been advised to book a ticket to guarantee a seat on the flight i now had two set of ticket for same flight up to now getting a refund is a nightmare,negative

london heathrow to edinburgh awful awful company my randomly allocated seat were middle seat in the back two row on both flight seems like punishment for not paying their charge to select seat i m not too bothered about the lack of drink meal service but can see that the system they have created is a shamble no cash payment option not enough stock etc etc on arrival back at heathrow t we were parked on a remote stand by t and then had to wait an hour for a bus to the terminal the staff could not have cared less and spent the time chatting about how low ba had sunk how staff morale wa terrible and how they could escape save your cash and go with a genuine budget airline would be my advice,negative
although they indicate it s against their policy they apparently waited for a passenger to get on the flight from new york jfk to london heathrow causing a min delay a a result we missed our connecting flight for all the other connection that were missed they had arranged for alternative and announced them before the flight landed however they did not announce any arrangement for out flight even though we specifically asked the flight attendant to check this is the second time in two year i had poor experience with british airway their service is consistently unacceptable,negative
gatwick to antigua this wa our first time in quite a while travelling from the south terminal and the first impression wa that the ba check in area wa a little cramped it wa quite busy at the cw check in with about five couple in front of u but a there were four desk open we were through in about five minute the fast track security wa quiet and we were soon in the new lounge this is a huge improvement from it predecessor in the north terminal with nice view comfortable seat and reasonable food i had a small bacon roll and a very strange omelette roll the departure gate wa quite cramped with not enough seating for all of the passenger but a the flight wa on time it didn t really matter we had made the decision some time ago not to pay an additional cost to select our seat prior to the hour check in a this would have cost up to for my wife and i depending where you wanted to sit however we were pleasantly surprised with the seat we were allocated a we would probably have chosen these anyway after boarding we were offered a glass of sparkling wine which for a change wa pleasantly chilled the staff were generally friendly especially a young guy who said it wa his first long haul trip once airborne we were offered two drink with nut before lunch and then more drink with lunch we had pre ordered our food so we knew what we were getting although the quality wa just ok i ordered a chicken curry which wa rather bland the interior of the plane wa rather showing it age with stain on the carpet with an overall drab ambience also the ife seems to be getting worse and unusually my wife found it difficult to watch a film due to the poor resolution afternoon tea wa ok although no provision wa made for my wife s sandwich she is a vegetarian so we had to mix and match between the two of u we landed on time in antigua overall the flight wa enjoyable without ever achieving any great height pardon the pun and importantly with a good cabin crew we were able to enjoy the experience,positive
berlin tegel to london heathrow in club europe business class a weekend evening flight that wa quite empty i had selected a very cheap offer to upgrade to business class and for once it wa worth the extra had checked in online so no contact with ground staff and having arrived to berlin from beijing with a tight connection i did not bother to use the terrace lounge here knowing the lounge from previous visit the staff are okay a fair range of snack and drink but lounge can become crowded and you have to walk outside the lounge to find toilet boarding wa quick only out of seat occupied in club cabin seat having limited seat pitch and are economy style with middle seat empty captain very informative and they are ba s biggest asset for the detail provided to customer a hot chicken sandwich cheese biscuit and chocolate mousse wa served all to a good standard drink of your choice from the bar and decent coffee to follow cabin staff were extremely friendly and efficient probably due to being a quiet saturday evening flight,positive

i am one of those crazy people who still until recently flew edinburgh london heathrow weekly paying nearly with british airway a it s the key airport now the last flight always come to a remote stand and the morning flight boarding for flight is onto a bus to a plane that is never ready and always departs late holiday in madeira ended with me and mum sitting on the floor in a departure hall for hr i wrote to ba and got the big fob off add insult to injury and no food at all on the plane so game over for me and any trace of a relationship it s now tedious you have to put in all the effort to loyalty with absolutely no return affection,negative
return trip for me and my wife using avios flying from london heathrow to miami staff were very friendly and professional on both sector flight on time food and drink choice quality were decent but not on a par with some other carrier it s clear ba s cost cutting affect all cabin on the outbound leg my choice of main course wa unavailable a they had already been given to other passenger having said that i could have ordered in advance via the web site on the return leg it s worth noting that access to from the lounge is via a single elevator and very time consuming so it wa a nice touch that one of the ground staff escorted me and my wife we are both gold card holder from the lounge and put u on the aircraft first a the boarding gate wa chaotic due to it being a holiday weekend overall very enjoyable flight but not any better than some airline business class,positive
ba onboard british airway a for the gruelling hour from singapore to london heathrow is pretty hellish for economy passenger i d like to be biased to ba i m silver member and british and it s my national carrier but come on let s get to the chase this route is now also served by garuda and singapore and i can say ba are at the bottom of the list for the economy service seat are really uncomfortable and near impossible to find an angle to get some rest the pillow are wafer thin like sitting on a a bunch of tissue bundled together food is lousy and they have removed the silverware and dinner extra like cracker chocolate and other thing that you can snack on they close down the rear galleyway and turn it into their personal hang out area instead of a self service drink and snack zone like other airline this also mean you are stuck in your aisle which is frustrating when you want to get to an unoccupied toilet in the other aisle and your toilet section ha queue further toilet are not regularly cleaned and soap ran out half way through the flight and wasn t refilled ba have downgraded their economy service in all area and you feel like the crew treat you like a poor peasant polite and respectful but minimum effort on the plus movie selection is great and tv on the a is good but not in singapore airline league your air mile earning for this route is more generous than garuda and singapore i would recommend premium economy if you can or if you have to make this route try and get upper deck where configuration is rather than downstairs or alternatively try the competition which will soon include norwegian air and i can t see how norwegian economy class can be any worse than ba s,positive

bangkok to london heathrow boarding wa the usual farce with unintelligible boarding announcement resulting in a free for all the flight wa packed full the inflight entertainment system didn t work for the entire flight this is a hour flight and also with time spent on the ground waiting for push back nearly hour i have noticed that ba don t seem to care about ife not working on ba and ba a it ha been quite usual on this route for some passenger to be complaining but this time it wa an aircraft wide problem effecting all passenger the captain made a number of announcement apologising and asking passenger for patience and explaining that it wasn t the cabin crew fault they were obviously experiencing passenger dissatisfaction he explained that the system had overheated well that calm thing i do not eat the served meal on board due to becoming very unwell on a previous ba flight i never want to experience again so i wa looking forward to eating the snack which are usually available however i wa told they had been withdrawn i wa not happy but had brought a sandwich from the airport so although felt very hungry i managed but remembered how well eva air compare with sandwich and even pot noodle between meal the cabin crew were nice but after serving meal stored their trolley between the two aft toilet next to the rear door both side of the aircraft effectively blocking access to all the toilet passenger wanting the toilet had quite a struggle to push past them i have never seen or experienced this on any flight and wondered if this is actually a safety concern ie blocking door i also experienced sinus problem pain and congestion which is i believe due to the air quality on boeing airplane the air being very dry with little humidity i do take precaution but it ha taken a month to recover from the terrible headache sinus pain and congestion i only experience this after flying on s and there are flight crew forum on line discussing air quality problem the captain wa on hand to apologise for disembarking passenger and wa clearly annoyed that the plane wa not fully serviceable i complained to ba and also emailed ceo alex cruze having been urged to do so by the crew my email to the ceo wa forwarded to customer service no surprise there customer service who replied quickly investigated and confirmed that there were time constraint loading food and a full compliment wa not loaded hence no snack i wa advised that the lack of ife would be investigated by their maintenance team they would not acknowledge any problem with the air quality but i didn t expect them to by way of compensation i wa given avios point which to me is paltry especially a those point have been radically devalued for economy passenger they are worth a third of what they were a year ago and can only be used where avios are accepted frankly i am disappointed in both the flight and ba s level of compensation i have tried to stay loyal to our national carrier but currently have no confidence anything will be done to improve the passenger experience on this route the only way to check is to fly that route again with ba do i risk it therefore i will be looking at all option in the future including middle eastern airline with a plane change,negative
istanbul to london i am sad to say british airway is little more than a budget airline masquerading a a really very expensive one it hard to see any difference between my flight experience on a budget airline and british airway except the ticket price my disappointment is so high because i had high expectation i paid extra for a more comfortable trip and instead felt totally ripped off every possible shortcut is taken to ensure your discomfort and their profit margin i haven t flown british airway for year and i shocked by how much it had gone downhill it is riding on it once good reptutation and short changing customer save you coin for something else you don t get what you pay for with british airway,positive
belfast to seoul via london heathrow pretty poor short haul connection to london wa good before you had to pay for food and drink and genuinely felt like there wa more leg room than the long haul flight from london wa very cramped i m slightly above average height but by no mean a giant and i really struggled to get comfortable seat wa too narrow very little leg room and the space to put my foot wa taken up by what i assume wa the processor for the ife system for the seat in front the seat wa very narrow and got pretty uncomfortable after around hour the food wa ok nothing special not very much of it and the thimble of drinking water you get every few hour is hardly enough a a child i remember the food on ba flight being very good but something ha gone terribly wrong staff are one of the few thing ba ha going for it at the minute one of the few thing left from the ba of old when it wa actually worthy of the name friendly staff on the flight and in the airport flew the same route with qatar airway a few month before and they were quite simply in a different league one last note you build this terminal which is meant to be world class firstly there is no smoking area although we re constantly being told not to smoke many people still chose to you expect people to wait in your terminal for hour on connection and we can t even enjoy a fag in the process though it seems the toilet are an unofficial smoking area a you re normally met with a wall of smoke when you walk in i am not someone who can walk into an airport and buy a rolex and a gucci outfit like most people i recommend you set up some shop where normal people can actually afford the thing in them rather than just window shop,positive
paris to london heathrow i am a ba gold guest list member with tier point i cannot believe what is happening to ba the attendant and crew look embarrased to be offering such a poor quality product cramped seat chaotic boarding every flight announced our flight is busy today so if you want to check bag in other word they have crammed in so many seat there is no room for cabin luggage now you pay for food and even water two trolley pas very slowly down the aisle because it take so long to serve and pay for food or drink effectively blocking access to the toilet for the whole flight how can they let a cost cutting ceo with no understanding of quality service run a premium priced airline it is appalling and this is no more than a high cost carrier with low cost service a shame to be called british this airline is in terminal decline and i need to look for matched status from a proper premium airline don t pay for ba shortfall use cheap alternative it the same service,negative
world traveler plus from heathrow to sfo the only whinge we had with the experience is that the new entertainment system had to be re booted boarding wa pretty much average with no zone boarding for economy just everybody get on first time in premium economy and we loved it where ba shined wa post flight i did the unforgivable and walked off with the wrong checked bag discovered it hour drive later got contacted by staff at ba luggage and in spite of the mess being entirely my fault immediately volunteered to fedex overnight my bag to me also having just come from a cruise on a line famed for it food the food stood up surprisingly well compared to oceania s,positive
buenos aire to london i wa warned that ba had gone downhill but i decided to give it a try on this long haul flight to start with you cannot reserve your seat prior to check in unless after paying over for a business class ticket you are willing to spend some additional per leg to have your seat reserved i call this insane to be honest so i waited and waited and waited till check in opened and made it to get a forward facing aisle seat latam lounge in buenos aire wa nice food average but connecting from santiago i had the time to take a shower with ground crew extremely nice and attentive boarding wa sort of a mess a ba let frequent flyer not flying business board through the business class door so there wa a flood of people moving back and forth to get to the rear of the plane crew simply unable to handle this process so you did not feel like being taken care of during boarding aircraft wa a class boeing and looked a bit tired seat wa the absolute worst part of this flight a it is narrow too hard to have a nice sleep and for aisle passenger this configuration feel like having a wall on one side and being exposed to people trolley passing through the aisle on the other side once flat it is a little short too even for me i m cm high no giant here and narrow so you find yourself forced to sleep on a side in addition to that when you lie down the drawer is not accessible therefore you have literally no space to store anything not even your glass if you wear them food wa just ok i still can t understand how ba can run out of entr e option in business class crew very mature for such a long trip but friendly and nice it really show they are suffering from these cost cut a they keep apologizing for everything that is not available or not working entertainment system made me smile a bit a the selection of movie wa ok but the screen wa much smaller than some other carrier economy class one to sum up it wa an average flight if it wa not for the lie flat seat i would call it more a premium economy experience than a business one ba need to improve business class a they are well below par if compared to almost all european carrier not even to compare the middle east airline,positive
gatwick to pisa check in at gatwick a breeze chaotic boarding process though flight took off approximately minute late the cabin crew were exceptional and are one thing that ba have going for them middle seat vacant in business class but in reality no extra leg room in the seat and if the passenger in front decides to recline you have even less room a for the catering ba are getting this wrong why are they insisting on dumbing down on their once reasonable standard i hardly call cheese on toast a satisfactory meal choice despite calling it croque monsieur it is still cheese on toast what ever way you look at it i hope mr cruz read these review it is not what the customer want ba are turning into a high cost no frill airline so much for their motto to fly to serve remember mr cruz and mr walsh there are other airline offering a much better service,negative
flew british airway from london to dubai to start with awful seat i felt like i wa being squashed by both passenger on either side of me need more room then it wa rude staff i wa shocked to top it off when the host came around with the the food he completely skipped me and wa working his way back when i interrupted him to ask for food he got annoyed with me when i moved my seat back after they had removed the food tray a man behind me hit my chair and started yelling at me i m a female travelling alone and i felt frightened by that just show how little space everyone ha been given i m really disappointed with ba,negative
stuttgart to london with british airway how thing have changed passenger now queue at gate a with easyjet or ryanair rather than sitting and waiting to be called unsurprisingly boarding in stuttgart by agency staff wa chaotic unsure who wa entitled to what cabin crew increasingly young and inexperienced probably because older member have left in view of the transformation of british airway to a budget airline how visible this wa few people bothered to purchase the over priced snack and drink on offer once that wa out of the way the three cabin crew member gathered in the rear galley chatted and munched away at the spare food from the business class section which had been surreptitiously taken to the rear at the rear i noticed that one of the two lavatory for economy class ha now been ripped out and replaced by two seat without window directly opposite the one remaining toilet those passenger looked particularly unhappy not least because of the constant queue alongside them everything about british airway now is shabby telling passenger how little they are valued and this doe not even mention the extra cost for hold luggage and for seat reservation my ticket theoretically gave me a choice of seat but at the appointed time there were only four choice left so no i won t be flying them again unless all other option fail,negative
flew nice to gatwick for a sandwich in club class we travel in business class whether long haul or in europe for a better experience this is even more important now since the quality of service in economy ha nosedived under the stewardship of se or cruz it started badly when we discovered once more that the flight wa not at the terminal but in a remote location that required much waiting on a bus just like a charter flight i asked a staff member why this wa so to be told that the terminal wa too small to cope but i noticed low cost carrier norwegian wa parked on a jetty we had booked seat in the second row a we wanted a choice of hot meal those at the rear of club often have no option due to catering limitation passenger were offered a choice of a curry i think yum or salmon yuck by the time the nice crew got to u only salmon wa left this is high in potassium a fish i must avoid i asked why the other dish had run out by the second row only two were loaded wa the reply what two only for the whole of club yes i asked what else wa on board only to be told that i would have to pay for an m s sandwich from economy before some help from our avios the ticket cost it wa beyond belief that an executive card holder should be treated this way the very nice cabin crew were excruciatingly embarrassed ba should wake up before once loyal passenger swallow hard pun and migrate to other carrier i d rather fly easyjet and spend the change on a nice meal,positive

punta cana to gatwick return i would really like to say a good thing about my recent two flight with ba but can find nothing the layout of the business class cabin is so bad with half the seat facing backwards that you have someone staring at you when the little divider is not up the seat are extremely narrow that you cannot easily turn when they are in the sleep position and they are so low that it is almost impossible to get up from them in more than year of traveling i have not been in a worse business class the selection of film and music is limited and the screen small the food on the two trip wa passable but nothing more and the wine less than passable unless you like plonk i do not suppose it is much fun for the flight attendant to work in such a low class environment but they did not one thing more than wa absolutely necessary i have saved the best for last because on the return flight the temperature of the cabin wa close to freezing and i wore two pullover and a blanket and wa still cold i know that many former ba customer have been bemoaning the fall in standard aboard and i regret that i join that group that will if possible never fly ba again,positive
washington to london heathrow return british airway seems to be having an identify crisis are they a full service or a low cost carrier the meal have been cut back to almost nothing seat selection fee abound and checked baggage fee may apply depending upon the the type of ticket purchased united airline now ha a better trans atlantic coach product than ba food on the outbound overnight flight breakfast ha been reduced to a granola bar on the return flight dinner wa tiny small amount of food in half filled bowl presented on a large tray a if to emphasize the lack of food and the pre landing snack ha been replaced with the aforementioned granola bar given the lack of food ba should just switch to buy on board so at least fewer people would go hungry flight crew seemed apologetic about the lack of food seat fee i don t know of any other full service carrier that will not assign a seat in advance a part of a paid ticket just assume it will cost you another or more per ticket on ba luggage fee completely opaque policy on our outbound trip we were told our ticket included one free checked luggage item on our return we were told checked bag would be extra although the kindly baggage check in attendant waived the fee for u no doubt he too is a much a victim of ba s indecipherable baggage fee policy a are passenger entertainment boeing outbound with good modern on demand ife system on the return a boeing the system wa an older on demand system with small blurry screen that were almost unwatchable cabin crew were generally friendly in fairness both our flight were on time and nothing went wrong but ba just feel cheap and stingy will likely fly the competition in the future,positive
new york jfk to london heathrow return my review is based on three different criterion service food and seat comfort overall the service wa very good the flight attendant were very attentive throughout the flight and very professional any request wa handled in a timely manner the flight wa full but service did not suffer the food on the flight wa absolutely disgusting and inedible a choice of thai vegatable curry or a chicken dish which i ate one bite of the highlight of the meal wa the two bite chocolate granache also they have eliminated the second meal snack service all they served wa tea coffee and a cookie very poor indeed seat comfort wa the best i ve experienced in economy i managed hour of sleep on a hour crossing the slideable headrest allow your head not to bob if not for the disgusting food i would give a,positive
malaga to gatwick the seat had barely any legroom and it reclines only or degree impossible to relax food and drink including coffee and water are now being charged and the airline only provides one trolley for whole plane we were sitting in row of and it took u nearly hour to be served and only card are accepted which make thing worse appalling if you want to fly like this fly ryanair for a fraction of the price,positive
stavanger to la vega via london heathrow this is a salute to the fantastic staff at terminal helping my group out when everything seemed lost because of american airline terrible customer service the trip wa originally meant to be a codeshare where we flew with ba booking under aa flight from lhr to la via jfk the trip took place on april rd we risked being stranded with out of traveler at lhr because of aa somehow magically losing our itinerary and not interested at all in helping rather blaming everyone else the ba service personnel spent hour trying to solve it and decided to take matter in their own hand they got u traveler on their direct flight from lhr to la the day after arranging for accommodation transport to from the airport and dinner breakfast even though aa wa mainly responsible for our journey the service on board wa to expect from a economy flight of that duration seat wa good food all right complimentary drink and very welcome the ife wa great the screen wa a little small compared to other newer aircraft s for this type of long haul but no particular issue,positive

prague to london heathrow british airway have lost the plot ba is now a budget airline and offer the bare minimum of service for a higher than budget fare check in is ridiculous a you wait for all the other category to be processed such a gold member bronze member family business class silver member they do at last get round to calling for anyone left and then it s a scowl from the shabby attendant a you board the plane seating is fair though leg room is tight the flight left a little late but arrived almost on time which wa fine there is no food nor even a coffee provided and a couple of flight attendant come down the aisle at a snail s pace with a trolley i can t believe ba now make passenger pay extra for food and drink ba show itself up a very much a budget airline and a fr cry from it illustrious past i wonder what ha happened to ba for it to have fallen so far this will be my last flight with ba unless there are no other option available a ba is more expensive than it direct budget competitor and not a full service airline anymore,negative
london to istanbul i am ever increasingly disappointed with british airway the constant penny pinching is having a material affect not only on the hard product but the staff who seem dispirited the seat lounge food aircraft cleanliness on board food and beverage all are sub par compared to rival airline my most recent flight back i took an aisle seat for a change the flight wa quite full and there are a constant stream of people from the economy cabin coming through the business class cabin to use the toilet this is really quite irritating especially during meal service no attempt wa made by the crew to stop this or even close the curtain splitting the cabin even after complaint i find the aircraft consistently dirty and on this flight someone had left chewing gum on the seat a well i think ba don t care on the flight from istanbul electronic device are banned other airline allow them up to boarding and then arrange for them to be taken off you british airway ha not even bothered to offer entertainment or even extra magazine on the flight they really don t appear to give any care for their passenger even those flying business class,negative
paris orly to new york via london unlike some american carrier and some other european carrier there is no beverage service on short haul flight tea cost pound economy overseas is a joke too they bring the premium drink service from the back to the front so economy class passenger get to see the kind of amenity they could have had they replaced the nd meal they used to offer with snack but of the option cooky snack sized kit kat and snack sized mar you may only have one i asked to have an extra snack i wa told no only one onboard medium is decent but nothing to write home about i classify this airline a slightly above a budget airline you do get one meal after all and entertainment but not much better than that,negative
los angeles to london heathrow i have to agree with all the other review on here ba have gone so far in cost cutting that the service the flight attendant are able to offer is just appalling there s just nothing positive left to say about them from the newly refurbished that look drab and cramped with the new uncomfortable slimline seat to the disgusting cheap meal the flight attendant were pleasant but you can see they re embarrassed and have nothing to offer all this would be fine but british airway still charge premium price and for what i just took a flight on the same route with virgin atlantic and what a difference all the little extra that make long flight bearable are still there and the price are cheaper i m afraid to say i won t be flying ba anymore unless it s to use up avios i d acquired,positive

a business class sale convinced me to give it a try on a trip home from sofia to boston i have to say that my wife daughter and i were completely pleased somewhat surprisingly so quick efficient checkin at the business class counter in sofia decent contract lounge excellent service and food onboard both the club europe flight to london and club world flight to boston terrific flight attendant and much better food than i am used to on united lh or austrian i have a gluten allergy and need to order special meal all three gluten free meal on this trip were among the best i have had all three included flavorful sauce which is something lh always omits from it special meal the gallery lounge in the b satellite terminal wa excellent not a much food on offer a in the lh and o lounge or even the new ua lounge at heathrow t but it wa quiet and comfortable and we really liked the quirky club world business cabin the middle section is great for couple every seat ha a storage drawer and the entertainment system wa solid there were four toilet for business class my only complaint the outrageous policy that required me to pay to reserve seat together in business class a the fight wa not full i probably could have gotten seat together at checkin but i did not want to take the risk and ba got additional revenue which is obviously why they do it,positive
an excellent experience on a roundtrip trip from hong kong to copenhagen through london despite being in economy class the flight attendant were attentive and also proactive serving our need before we even needed to ask they were friendly and made u feel completely at home the on board entertainment selection wa very extensive with high quality option english and international movie of high caliber and the screen interface wa modern and easy to use the seat on the flight from hkg lhr on the boeing er were new and much more comfortable than the average older seat the pilot wa incredibly descriptive of the flight path we were taking and kept u up to date in term of turbulence arrival time weather without being overbearing or overly disruptive with regard to the pre boarding ground service one of the check in representative went out of her way accommodating my boyfriend and i so that we could sit together and have a window seat both of which were not available at check in due to the fact that we had bought our ticket separately and had not selected seat beforehand we really appreciated her willingness to look at what she could do to make our trip more pleasant this wa not my first time flying with british airway but it had been a long time since i last boarded a long haul flight with them and the trip exceeded my expectation british airway in my opinion is not the outdated carrier that many deem it to be,positive

flew london gatwick to san jose costa rica we have flown business on numerous occasion and have noticed the decline in british airway the service on this flight wa appalling travelling a a couple we were sat in the centre seat which the cabin staff appeared to ignore when offering any of the cabin service i e drink towel etc the normal routine stuff on too many occasion we had to request attention chosen meal were not available on both outward and return flight and we were sat in row at the front of the service collection of waste item had to be requested the galley kitchen wa not restocked and by the end of the flight looked like a bomb site no glass or cup were available for even a glass of water cabin staff were noticeable by their absence during most of the flight hot towel will soon be the size of a postage stamp toilet bag are cheap ba have totally lost the plot they are no longer a premium service and willie walsh and co need to take a flight on emirate qatar etc to realise their failing business seating configuration is ridiculous passenger in the centre seat have to hurdle their way to the isle over the isle passenger leg a part of the same trip we made domestic flight to connect again service is in reverse but the cost aren t if ba want to become a budget airline then they need to offer budget fare i don t think they have a clue what they are doing in future we will avoid them unless absolutely necessary the only positive of the trip wa the lounge at gatwick the lounge at san jose is a joke,negative
the flight from new york jfk to london heathrow wa extremely uncomfortable although the entertainment wa quite good on the tv the food wa horrible plasticy tasting and above all not tasty the flight from heathrow back to jfk had many delay although this wa out of anyone s control it wa very inconvenient and there wa a terribly long wait to board the new plane hour at first we were told that we would be brought to a new plane a soon a possible but almost an hour later here were many other delay and disappointment that we were notified about the other passangers and myself should not have to wait for hour to get on a new plane i wish the discomfort of the plane bad food and time of delay were reduced dramatically so far not a good first trip on british airway,negative
very very poor customer service from british airway myself and my partner were on a flight that wa overbooked and so were accommodated on a different flight on the same day with a via point of oman while upset about the change of trip and the delay that would occur a a result we accepted that these thing happen and were told to go straight to boarding for our flight to oman when we asked about ticket for the second flight we were given a form of ticket and told we would have to visit the transfer desk in oman to get our boarding pass on arriving in oman they had no clue who we were and the flight we were meant to be on wa full we were left there for hour with no communication from anyone in a transfer unit with no shop or vending machine and no offer of refreshment after pleading with airport staff we were placed on a flight to bahrain and transferred to our original planned destination new delhi we were approximately hour delayed arriving and did not receive a single apology that day to say it wa a traumatising experience wa an understatement,negative
i had to change my flight back from san diego because of an accident that required a stay in hospital i d flown out first class and had a business class return i do understand why some fare structure mean that flight are not changeable but ba were absolutely no help at all they flatly refused to change the flight so i had to buy a ticket in the only available class world traveller plus which cost one way the first class fight to wa ok nice cabin crew and good food but grubby cabin and clear cost cutting no snack water etc in the galley like there used to be absolutely no help on the return trip despite request before the flight because i wa walking with a stick i d requested an aisle seat had to ask again at check in a they had given me a seat in the middle which would have really annoyed other passenger a i tried to get across them to go to the loo etc with my stick really poor value at and rubbish seat uncomfortable and tv screen that aren t great the food wa awful clear that cost are being cut massively maybe their plan is to offer such rubbish food that when they introduce food you have to buy in long haul we all feel grateful it s a pity really it s obviously ba call if they want to be a no frill airline but i d rather they were honest with u so that we can choose amongst the many other no frill airline but they keep trying to say that ba is a leading brand with strong value when clearly they ve decided to cut cost wherever they can but still charge high price might make them profitable to be a follower in the short term but i suspect people will vote with there foot and fly with someone else,positive
philadelphia to edinburgh via heathrow in january i ve always enjoyed flying british airway and usually make my yearly trip to philly with them rather than flying direct to newark via united the long haul flight wa ok food service wa a wee bit slow but it wa the usual chicken and rice which wa ok for an economy class flight however it wa a surprise to me that they no longer served breakfast or even a snack in the morning so the chicken wa the only food we got on the flight i wasn t too fussed about that until i got on my connecting flight to edinburgh where i found out that they no longer served free food by this point i wa pretty hungry so i caved in and got ready to pay for a bacon roll which never happened because the trolly never reached me to top it all off we left heathrow late because of a computer problem meaning i missed my train connection in edinburgh but i understand that these thing happen at time however recent cut to service and the upcoming densification of the long and short haul fleet make ba a lot less attractive furthermore the headphone jack on my ife wa loose so it wa quite difficult to watch film during the flight which wa disappointing on the up side the staff both at the desk and during the flight were great a always considering i got the flight for a good price it wa ok although i will definitely not be going out my way to fly ba and will just go for the cheapest or direct option in future i m indifferent in recommending flying with ba if they suit you best then go ahead but don t go out your way to fly them if there are cheaper or direct option just go for them instead because there isn t anything particularly outstanding,positive
well where do you start this is a business seat on a supposedly premium brand the ticket price wa in excess of the lounge at lhr t need work yes british airway are investing but long overdue the small lounge for b gate need to be re thought and offer better food option to the aircraft it been refitted apparently but should be scrapped the seat remain tired the vanity screen wa not working properly the entertainment system is past it best with smudge and scratch the carpet look like they need a very good clean and are grubby indeed the toilet are old overall the aircraft is well past what could be described a a premium regarding the crew they have been bashed and are a shadow of their former self sad but true too many apology for the rubbish decision of management on this trip the galley kitchen wa poorly stocked and many of the usual item were missing e g waitrose fruit and yogurt they have also stopped the ice cream food served wa not good saving grace wa the meat platter but what could you do to spoil sliced meat and cheese blanket are faded and ragged the toilet bag are a joke cheap and nasty this route wa the jewel in the airline crown and one that ha slide down the priority ladder ba need to invest in a new fleet re energise the crew change the catering and get a few more choice upgrade the seating and change seating configuration to avoid being an olympic pole vaulter,positive
london heathrow to singapore business class flight from heathrow to singapore flight took off over hour late with no real explanation why and we were not kept informed it seems ba is these day later in taking off during the flight i felt like many of the staff serving were not friendly a one would expect in any flight let alone in business class and my call to request additional water or other quite basic service element were not responded to with any friendliness or a service mindset the main meal we were served wa absolutely awful it wa supposed to be an asian meal of a curry with prawn but wa just like gunge and wa not edible i really don t know how they could have deemed this meal acceptable also the breakfast wa far too late and seemed to be a big rush to try and complete the service before the plane landed which seemed totally unnecessary a i wa hungry between course i went to the galley to get snack but the selection wa poor and the staff seemed to react badly to this for some reason i have noticed a big difference of the snack on offer in the past few year i have been a ba silver member for many year but now see no reason to renew i always try and fly qatar where possible when going to asia now a the service is better and often the price too there is nothing redeeming about ba,negative
what wa i thinking flying this airline for the second time travelling this airline our luggage ha been lost two year ago london to dublin our bag were lost for two day so this flight our bag are left in london again now i m stuck in dubai in winter clothes missing the pool and beach at our resort waiting for our bag to turn up it s only been day now in the same clothes upside service on board ba wa excellent however business class on ba europe flight is no different to economy so don t pay for business if you think you are getting a comfy seat,negative
just got off the flight from heathrow to new orleans and have to say it wa one of the worst long haul economy class flight i have ever had to endure the legroom is an absolute joke for such a long flight first time i have ever been unable to open my laptop to work i now understand why they don t offer wifi on board the seat are minuscule and if you are unfortunate to be sitting next to somebody who is rather big boned shall we say then it is a dreadful experience in my section one of the toilet wa not working from the start of the flight and the other toilet rapidly descended into a disgrace with no cleaning done throughout the flight i have travelled a lot over the year first business and economy and had a gold british airway card but this wa just terrible and i don t really know what ba hope to achieve in the long run i can guarantee i will seek other airline first before considering them again anybody contemplating going to new orleans from heathrow fly with somebody else and get an internal connection you won t regret it a for ba they have about a much chance of me booking another flight with them long haul a trump ha of winning the nobel prize for oratory were it to exist,positive
we flew on a reward flight from london heathrow to brussels for a weekend and decided to treat ourselves to a full service experience we were very well looked after by superb flight attendant who had a great sense of humour the lunch wa chicken salad and a nice dessert what we did notice is that the legroom wa just the same a economy and seemed rather worse than usual the only perk we had wa a blanked off seat in the middle which if you are a bit chunky like me it wa quite difficult to manoeuvre this all tally with what ha been written in the newspaper and we like many other reviewer and frequent loyal flyer feel that ba is being turned into vueling if it weren t for the excellent pilot and flight attendant on ba who make our journey feel very comfortable and safe we would not travel on ba we would try to find another full service airline because we enjoy flying,positive
the cabin crew bar one lazy individual were excellent t feel like a monopoly gallery lounge food is simply appalling between breakfast and lunch there is no hot food unused hot food is removed at am sharp why not leave it so all you have is bread and stodgy croissant the upstairs of the a wa in need of a serious clean cabin crew friendly although you can sense lower morale ba flight are often late now in my experience the club world a seat aren t comfortable despite everyone knowing crossing over someone s leg too get out is still a nuisance there is a scrum it down for last use of toilet before landing i had one bloke shout at me when i d been waiting long before him and he d just turned up and tried to arrogantly barge in many long term loyal passenger are starting to feel disrespected and undervalued let down after year of loyalty and serious spending we re not getting what we re paying for although charged that s the sad bit,positive
i am just sad to have to write this review i changed from lufthansa to british airway more then year ago because it beening a premium airline that wa superior in any way mostly flying between berlin the u and in recent year very frequently cape town ba had more modern plane innovative product like a great rather new first class lie flat seat in business class a new premium economy and a very good economy with good seat and legroom flying from cape town to berlin in january to keep my silver status made me realise that none of my initial reason to choose ba still exists with the exception of the great cabin staff that i feel really sorry for the owner hired lex cruz last year a very experienced low cost airline executive and he is doing the best he can turning ba into a low cost carrier unfortunately the result is a pity no more service on short haul flight reduced service only paid snack on long haul worn s to cape town and the grimm outlook to be traveling in cramped in s with and extra seat squeezed in from next year onwards british airway a a premium airline is lost realistically for year to come even with my status renewed i don t think i will fly them again if i don t have to meanwhile i understand that company sometimes unterstand and correct their mistake i do hope ba will do so in the hopefully not to distant future and keep their great staff on ground and on board,positive
no no no british airway you ve messed up someone sat in an office thought it would be a good idea to charge for food and drink on flight just like many other airline do and they said let s provide food from m s that will make our offering classier than the rest the problem on my flight from marrakech to london wa that it being dinner time load of passenger wanted food and drink so the service wa inevitably snail paced a piece of friendly advice ba you need to provide cabin crew to handle economy on a dinnertime flight or you merely annoy your customer sitting near the back of the plane my wife and i got served hour into the hour flight by which time our tongue were hanging out but what s this only two sandwich left and we bagged the last two packet of crisp you re promising thing you can t deliver ba there is such a thing a advertising standard and your beautifully photographed food and drink menu drive a coach and horse through the principle of advertising standard the cabin crew serving economy soldiered on with their service most impressively even managing to smile a for the umpteenth time someone s payment card failed to register on their machine hint for frequent flyer if your card just doesn t work you get your food and drink for free meanwhile behind the service trolley a phalanx of passenger with their leg tightly crossed tried to avoid exhorting the cabin crew to move their trolley so they could access the toilet to relieve themselves a very appropriate expression in the circumstance other passenger simply wanted to relieve themselves of the packaging of the food they bought hour earlier several of them eventually came down the aisle waving their empty bottle and m s extensive food packaging for the crew to remove from their sight whoever at british airway is employed to read review on this website please take note and pas it on to your management if you dare the process i call ryanisation of british airway is almost complete you now charge for checked baggage yes i know that s indirect but only idiot can t see through the scam you exert an extortionate price for those unfortunate enough to be tall and who need the legroom of emergency exit seat and now you ve devised a marvellous system of charged cabin service for food and drink on short haul what even ba used to call medium haul flight that annoys more than half the customer on board the plane oh and by the way why don t the cabin crew deploy the a overhead monitor that display the flight progress too costly perhaps i suggest that ba need to return to the day of advertising when you had a wonderful slogan but with a minor revision british airway the world s least favourite airline,positive
having only flown easyjet ryanair for all my short haul journey over the last year or so i wa pleased to see a relatively low cost ba flight for my round trip from london to rome in hindsight i wish i d booked a different airline and not booked ba based on it legacy reputation to say that this wa a disappointing experience would be an understatement i expected at the very least an equivalent service to that of other low cost short haul airline certainly not worse narrow seat are to be expected but these seemed far more narrow than the norm regardless of this there is no excuse for a seat being so uncomfortable even on a hr trip this wa almost unbearable coupled with the fact that at a relatively small my knee were grazing the seat in front lucky the seat had no recline feature to make matter worse i wa also tantalised by the ba bragging of m s supplied food i am more than happy to pay for this on a short haul flight and don t expect anything for free it certainly looked delicious from the picture and description sadly being sat in row this meant that after the frustratingly slow pace of the cabin crew finally getting to me meant that they had run out of pretty much everything no sandwich no fruit salad no yoghurt i asked what they did have their response bottle of water or a kit kat after asking the cabin crew why there wa so little option their response wa surprising to say the least they never give u enough food it s mad they give u sandwich for the whole flight needless to say that ba can no longer live on their past reputation they had an opportunity to position themselves a the best of the low cost carrier sadly they probably sit about th or th down the list i d say i d give their long haul a chance but after this experience i won t bother what a shame,positive
london heathrow to munich return it used to be an enjoyable experience flying ba sadly all the cutback are kicking in now and travelling ba just feel like a bit of a chore the loss of the free bar food service on european flight is a real step down even worse is the cynical way in which it happened downgrading the food offering so much that it seemed like an improvement to offer paid for m s food on board oh and how replacing my free drink with the same drink only now i have to pay is an improvement in service is beyond me not even a free tea or bottle of water i asked for tap water on a flight earlier this year to avoid paying only to find it tasted of chlorine wouldn t recommend you do the same the card only payment system is chaos a well it take forever for the trolley to get from one end of the plane to the other next on the list is the outrageous price that ba charge to select a seat in advance not wishing to pay this by the time i checked in for this flight the maximum hour in advance there were only or seat on the whole plane i could choose from i took the sole window seat available right at the back of the plane which is far from my first choice of seat other carrier let you select seat at check in for free and easyjet charge about half of what ba charge to select the equivalent seat in advance and if you pick one of the preferred seat with easyjet you also get priority check in and boarding for your money not so with ba check in at t wa also a hassle on this occasion a the first check in machine wouldn t work at all and the second printed a boarding pas but wouldn t let me print a bag tag so i couldn t use the bag drop counter after all and had to queue up at the check in desk wasting time there wa a minor delay due to fog but that wasn t ba s fault and didn t have a hige impact flight itself wa pretty smooth and cabin crew were good on the way back our business meeting finished early so we tried to take advantage of the one remaining real pro to flying ba in europe with standard economy fare the ability to switch between flight for free on the day could we no the earlier flight wa full rather than sit in munich airport all afternoon we rebooked on lufthansa instead in summary if flying ba on european route these day be aware that ba is now a no frill carrier lower your expectation to this level and you ll probably have a pleasant flight,positive
belfast to gibraltar via heathrow return i fly british airway when i can and have always been impessed and satisfied until now the flight from heathrow to gibraltar wa uneventful clean aircraft no delay no issue apart from the lack of drink snack i d love to know who thought this would be a good idea flying short haul there is nothing to differentiate ba from easyjet or other no frill airline add to this the lack of choice on their menu there are only a couple of sandwich and if you don t like mayo or cheese you re out of luck well done ba you ve alienated loyal customer and are hardly likely to attract new one the flight from heathrow to belfast is my main gripe the flight wa meant to depart at but wa delayed to hardly a big deal right wrong the gate only went up at this led me to a bus which took u to the aircraft it wa before everyone wa boarded again hardly a big deal except that we didn t take off until which meant that my dog had to spend an extra night in kennel a i wa back too late to pick them up the flight itself wa full which wouldn t have been too bad if there hadn t been a lady sitting a couple of row in front of me who stank i won t go into detail but she smelled rancid i wa a few row back and so didn t get the worst of it but i could see others who were closer who were not having a good time at all needless to say i didn t enjoy the flight at all i would go so far a to say that it s probably the worst flight i ve been on and i ve flown monarch and easyjet i did e mail ba with my concern but they didn t bother to reply so again well done ba you re squandering customer good will toward you like you re burning fifty pound note,negative
flew from gatwick to cancun british airway have lost their way front line staff are still excellent but behind the scene customer service is now at an all time low the quality of aircraft and seating is below other airline they need to sharpen up their act before even more passenger desert then,negative
british airway ha got it wrong on short european haul malaga to gatwick and if you are seated at the front end of the economy class the food drink trolley will block access to the toilet seated at the tail end of the plane the food is very likely to run out on my flight the promised m s wa limited to snack water kitkat credit debit card only no cash and this meant a very painfully slow service one working toilet for the economy class the other one wa out of order but the business class toilet at the front wa out of reach for the cattle class leaving me wait for over an hour i wa not allowed to use the one working toilet at the back of the plane for about minute a combination of food trolley blocking the aisle then of air turbulence the cabin crew seems desperate to get the trolley hence the slowness to the end of the cabin people needing the toilet wa obviously not a priority they certainly did not let me pas during the minute or more without air turbulence ba ha gone cattle,negative
london to new york it ha been a long time since i have been on a british airway flight and time ha not been kind t at lhr is cavernous and reasonably easy to navigate once you work out where thing are it just feel a bit hit and miss compared to changi or hk the flight itself wa on an old b new seating and ife but very old the boarding process wa chaotic extra security check at the gate itself hardly surprising seat comfort wa ok albeit very tight and narrow the ife wa great and that wa the highlight the lunch served wa so so but having eaten at the lounge it wa left largely uneaten the biggest problem is the staff morale they all seemed to be keen to get the service out of the way dim the light and disappear evidence of cost cutting in that water wa only provided if asked for any wine wa by the glass very cheap cutlery etc ba is a premium airline but look to be offering a ryanair standard compared to the me or asian or my usual ride qantas ba have slipped significantly shame a it wa a great airline to fly with at one time,positive
flight from gatwick to grenada return with british airway lounge in south terminal wa good flight and staff were good decent food and the plane wa clean what i struggled to get my head around is after paying for business class flight ba then expect you to pay an additional per person each way to reserve seat there were of u traveling so that add in excess of to our flight cost ba will tell you that this is free hour before departure but actually day before departure most seat had gone i would expect after paying for business class that you automatically get seated together but it appears not a there wa one couple on the return flight who had not reserved seat after paying for business class and were made to stand in the galley until everybody had boarded to if there were seat together,positive
flew from lisbon to london and return british airway never fails in term of being on time but i will end my business with them after more then flight and having said very good thing about them in the past they seem to be cutting corner with everything passenger are not given even a small cracker and for some strange reason the plane doe not stop at the hub just go to a remote stand and take forever to get to the terminal not worth the money spent,positive

i have never had such a bad experience with british airway before the cabin staff were rude lazy and obviously did not want to provide a service the flight wa from mauritius to gatwick on sunday th march landing monday morning th march no second cup of coffee offered at breakfast we had to take our own plate back before landing and on two occasion the steward pointed to a cloth on the floor and expected me to pick it up without a please or a thanks food wa good the staff were absolutely appalling we pay good money for business class and this chaotic and rude service is not what i expect from my national airline,negative
london heathrow to hong kong the new premium economy seat is a vast improvement on the previous seat but i wa hugely disappointed however with the inflight offering for a hour flight in a premium economy i would have assumed it would be similar to others offering meal mid flight snack and other bit i wa very wrong we had a bar service and meal there wa then nothing until breakfast exactly the same a the economy offering this is appalling british airway ha really gone downhill with it measly service offering i went to speak the crew at the rear of the aircraft they completely understood customer frustration they just have nothing to give ba wa once a carrier you looked forward to flying with not so much anymore the crew were friendly but even they seem to have lost the passion they once had for anyone flying ba bring yourself some additional snack onboard especially if your travelling with kid,negative
frankfurt to hong kong via london this will definitely be my last time with british airway i have already changed my return ticket to cathay pacific the business class experience with ba ha suffered so much cost cutting they are well below every major competitor short flight to heathrow and the afternoon snack wa pitiful probably worth about at most seat legroom is awful and not far off the inch size that economy is being cut to staff onboard were friendly and that is all lounge at t wa again very poor crowded food choice and standard like a cheap motorway caf dirty and nobody seemed to be cleaning the toilet wa disgusting evening departure to hkg and went back into the terminal to find something proper to eat onboard the ba club world product is lousy cheap low quality amenity a very poor meal choice and standard washroom unstocked and quite dirty the cabin worn and scruffy a an expat living in germany i have remained loyal to ba until now but this is the last time i will waste our company money using them it is quite clear that ba are abusing their monopoly situation at heathrow cutting their own cost to boost shareholder return without giving one thought to the longer term reputation and profitability of the airline if you are undecided about choosing ba over another airline quite simply do not consider ba you will be very disappointed and feel cheated,negative
london to nairobi return in february during the industrial action we found the crew to be friendly and attentive the food wa ok i had the spicy chicken which i didn t much care for it wa rather unusually badly prepared with great hunk of chicken and vegetable just not a nice a the beef my husband wa eating on the return flight we were flight attendant down due to the strike but they were excellent and more than made up for the missing staff i know that there ha been a lot of gripe about ba downgrading it service but these flight were really good and that there were lot of drink run during the sleep time didn t much care for the cereal bar but the cup of tea made up for that,positive

british airway use a version of the with a minimal number of economy seat on this route from london heathrow to johannesburg every seat on both outward and return flight wa occupied they make a bigger profit by having more seat in business class etc and so squeeze the economy class people into a confined area seat are narrow seat cushion are hard and i had a large person next to me both trip i paid for an aisle seat in each case but comfort is impossible food wa passable and no more but there were two meal on the long flight cabin crew were surprisingly young and seem to be in training polite and efficient but they had obeyed the instruction to disappear for most of both flight both flight on time these ancient s are showing their age even though both of these had been revamped they looked tired but clean the alternative aircraft used on this route is and airbus but a fellow passenger said that the seat were even tighter on that aircraft it is tiie that ba started to compete and not be so complacent,positive

london to barbados having used avios point when making the reservation we were very disappointed about the high charge to reserve seat in advance the crew were very pleasant and the aircraft wa reasonably clean but there wa choice of main meal available british airway policy of offering a fun size mar bar instead of a second meal is unacceptable in our opinion the airline are offering a budget experience at a premium price and we will not be making any further booking with them,positive

newark to london heathrow this wa the first time i have flown long haul ba for sometime although i am ba goldcard holder due to my travel on other oneworld carrier the lounge in newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate first section and food is only offered for business and first passenger super view over the airfield boarding wa smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition this wa a new boeing however the ying yang seat configuration no air vent high density poor quality food and very little of it very basic toilet facility compared to american business class on the same route a shoe bag instead of amenity kit the product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product flight attendant were ok but just going through the motion i asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this wa forgotten about the arrival lounge is grim tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabin which are not clean and too small overall very poor and i will not fly with them again unless no other option,negative
hyderabad to london i have travelled ba numerous time and had very good experience up until this past week when i wa returning from hyderabad to london from a business trip and wa downgraded a cabin while the downgrade itself wa not to so much the problem the manner in which the ba staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded wa extremely disappointing i have had previous experience of being inconvenienced by change in cabin fair or cancelled flight on other airline and in such instance those airline did a fantastic job of providing alternative or compensation for my trouble in this instance with british airway i wa very surprised to find that the company a a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me when i asked if i could be put on another comparable flight i wa shut down and told no this is not possible without any explanation when i then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline i wa told again and again no this is not possible after realising that british airway wa in no way going to try and remedy the situation i asked what could be done given the circumstance my answer wa a to be handed a gift card and be told that there wa essentially nothing i could do about it a the airline wa under no legal obligation to provide the service ticket class i had purchased after the flight i filed a claim with british airway and sent email to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience but i have yet receive even one response only adding to my understanding that british airway doe not value myself a a customer or my business i am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline,negative
london to chicago in my opinion british airway have massively decreased in value for it customer both within europe and internationally especially a an economy passenger they are moving more towards being a budget airline there is no option of a free seat selection they charge for food on board on short haul flight on long haul flight they removed a second meal with shabby option of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal avios and tier point award have been slashed i will not be flying ba any more and will be taking my money elsewhere,positive
london to vancouver return british airway is no longer good value for money the cost of premium economy compared with the quality of service food and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise the plane in both direction wa old and shabby staff are fine but don t really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience particular bugbear were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online a soon a it opened of course you have the opportunity to pay an extra each way to choose a seat beforehand the food quality seems to have declined in the past few year and on a pm return flight it took a good few hour to serve the premium economy cabin the tv screen are dirty and small the system had to be reset on the flight out took quite a while for almost double the price of economy i don t think it make sense to fly world traveller plus on this route,positive
flew london heathrow to gibraltar this is probably the last time that i ll book a short haul with british airway from heathrow for anything other than a long holiday no matter how cheap they make it they can t overcome the structural issue of long walk to gate delay for take off slot long walk back to passport control then long queue a passport control and a schlep back to transport willie walsh wa saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher price for premium airport slightly hollow laugh ba are further constrained by their class cabin configuration which effectively mean that the majority of passenger in economy are served by only x cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilet on our flight of well over hour this meant that the final few row did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loo were effectively out of use i have no objection to paying for food and drink but ba have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loo reasonably easily seems like a structural flaw in their offering the other frustration wa the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which lead to a scrum to get your bag stowed it took me back to the early day of easyjet and ryanair before allocated seating so unless i m lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few row i think i ll use regional airport and the better general service and available loo that come with a single class cabin no matter who the carrier is,positive
this is my first time flying on ba s a daily service between london heathrow and singapore i chose a seat on the upper deck of the a seat a an exit row seat located just behind world traveller plus this seat ha enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out the inflight entertainment wa adequate and featured some of the latest movie the classical music selection wa severely limited though bbc news wa on the menu but ironically it wa not available for some strange reason inflight service wa basic there wa only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passenger for their drink selection for dinner in other word you would have to order your orange juice coke and wine at the same time cabin crew came around to clear dinner tray too fast even before passenger had finished their meal throughout the night of this red eye flight i did not see any cabin crew coming around with drink the lhr vce route wa operated by the a british airway had recently withdrawn free inflight snack and drink for it european route and passenger are now required to purchase drink and m s snack on the whole ba will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frill in economy class unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist i would choose another airline,positive
british airway are really trying to take all the worst part of the budget airline and make a uniquely poor offering i recently flew with ba from gatwick to marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of easyjet the catering with the new m s food can be described a nothing short of chaotic on the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey wa a kitkat cost cutting includes removing toilet is one toilet for people realistic ba,negative
london heathrow to cape town return this return journey wa the worst long haul flight that i ve ever taken british airway boeing ha been configured to cram in a many seat a possible so with only toilet to cater for the front cabin queue were or people long continuously throughout the flight there wa hardly any legroom and while it s good that the seat recline quite a way it s impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seat the seat are very narrow so put pressure on my elbow when i wa trying to sleep i m not a large lady only kg and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour wa constantly switching my light on accidentally i gave up trying to watch a movie a the screen wa so close to my face i couldn t focus on it the inflight meal wa also very poor unlike the food we had on five internal flight on saa which wa excellent british airway have lost the plot fly with someone else,negative
oh dear cost cutting on british airway ha led to them becoming an embarrassment flew kuwait to edinburgh via london aircraft are still comfortable timekeeping is good and information from the flight deck is always forthcoming however most of the cabin crew were mature and the food and drink offering is now minimal breakfast from kuwait wa egg mixed with vegetable no not the omelette we used to have plus mushroom and potato both prepared a a mushy sort of tortilla both looked like something you would spoon out of a tin for a baby lunch wa a mar bar or similar i did not bother with the buy on board stuff on the flight to edinburgh i get a better choice in the terminal when i get off the aircraft the domestic flight back from edinburgh to heathrow had the most appallingly childish cabin crew i have ever seen on ba giggling at each other during the safety demonstration very unprofessional the evening meal out of london back to kuwait wa more like a snack with a smallish steak three snap pea three baby carrot i counted the thing and another babyfood potato thing breakfast wa a muesli bar sorry guy a comment on this board that ba equal budget airline just about sum it all up i have other choice from the gulf back home and next time i will be thinking about taking one of them the only attraction with ba is the extra legroom in premium economy the choice of entertainment and the direct flight to heathrow rather than having to fly down the gulf and return otherwise the epitaph how the mighty have fallen spring to mind,positive
london heathrow pisa return i fly this route often a i have a house in tuscany i fly british airway club europe only because the fa are better the lounge is a welcome benefit and if you book far ahead enough you can get a reasonable deal plus avious point that aside there is little benefit to flying say ryanair the trip started at t and the northern lounge wa not for a change to busy had a fruit and coffee breakfast the option were a group of highly unhealthy looking bacon bap dripping fat all over the place some year ago ba provided some nice scrambled egg now they don t flight left from the a terminal and we boarded downstairs from the lounge the plane wa half full it wa clean and valeted we pushed back minute early my wife had a sort of brunch thing cheese and ham roll she said it wa ok i had a couple of gin and tonic the fa said she had never seen such an empty flight and neither had i for that matter the now chargeable food and beverage in economy went down like a lead balloon apparently i read the ba brochure on the now chargeable food and a a sale and marketing professional it wa the most patronising piece of rubbish i d ever read it read a if ba were providing the most amazing product to the benefit of all and goodness me the product are not cheap over a for a kit kat we landed ahead of time and ha to walk the tarmac like ryanair customer several year ago you had the air bridge now you don t the return flight started in the shared lounge which wa rammed this in part is due to qatar airline operating out of pisa and their business class customer use the same facility some booze and snack nothing edible flight delayed by minute plane wa rammed very pleasant fa afternoon tea with horrible dried out sandwich scone that didn t look like scone on both flight the usual three seat with the centre seat being a table no legroom hopelessly inadequate product which can be a high a return docked at the b terminal and had to walk mile to the train that took u back to t terminal a all in all another disappointing experience from the world s most frugal airline,positive

london heathrow to miami i paid extra for an exit seat this is the best thing to do make sure you get the one closest to window mainly because no one stand there to stretch their leg etc you get unlimited leg room and the ability to stand up and wander stretch whenever you want and it is good value on a ten hour flight the seat on the a are narrow the entertainment system the usual etc the meal were fine my major issue with british airway economy is their penny pinching you sit down there is no welcome snack you then have your meal and seven hour later if you are hungry you have to pay for basic snack it s ridiculous on american airline they put out box of pretzel biscuit etc which you can just help yourself to if you have a diet coke on american you get a full ml can on british airway you get the small version there are so few difference flying in economy between different airline these thing count ba ha no other major advantage so sadly why use them,positive
lisbon to london heathrow now that ba have started charging for all food and drink on short haul flight they might a well rebrand to a budget airline over the last few year leg room across european flight business and economy class ha decreased to the point where it now practically the same a any budget airline that said it is in practice worse than budget airline because at least the main budget carrier have done the decent thing of removing the seat recline button eliminating further discomfort even without the seat in front reclined anyone taller than will be packed in tightly on any european short haul flight the staff are friendly and polite however they are often struggling to pas through the whole economy cabin with drink food sale service especially when the plane is full and the flight is under hour min this doe not only result in thirsty hungry customer but also the almost permanent presence of the service trolley in the aisle blocking access to the toilet business class which i sometimes use is offered a free meal and drink all of a reasonable quality however in term of legroom seat size there is no benefit compared to economy the only reason i continue to fly ba is because i have fairly set route and ba generally fly at time which suit me otherwise i get little in the way of added value the benefit of avios point and moving up membership tier are hardly worth it in monetary term particularly if one mostly fly within europe it is much cheaper to get a lounge membership many are valid for most european and beyond airport rather than remain loyal to ba these day i have been flying with ba for well over a decade now on a monthly basis my sympathy go to the staff because i fear cost cutting will get them next which will no doubt be to the detriment of the high standard the crew maintain to this day,positive
berlin tegel to london heathrow i decided to give british airway a chance for a short weekend trip to london because when it come to price they cannot beat the low cost airline and what do you know i had a part of the low cost experience paying a bigger price no checked in luggage included not even a a oneworld emerald and you had to pay for your inflight snack and beverage a plus is that the price for the snack and drink were not a high a with other airline that have introduced this service lately and the quality wa good the price were even below airport one the bad thing wa indeed that they needed a lot of time to deliver all the product people were buying stuff and it took age until you could get your order well you can t compete with ryanair trying to do better the thing they do best i really miss the day when british airway wa offering tea nad coffee for free and a little snack it wa a pleasure to fly with them and i would be happy to get back to those day some good thing about the flight wa that they landed ahead of schedule boarding wa very efficient which is a big plus and the seat were gorgeous a lot of space very comfortable leather seat a an advice please don t try to be someone else stay where british airway used to be and the success will come losing an identity can cause more financial damage then a sandwich and a tea offered for free,positive
istanbul to london heathrow i am a frequent flyer between turkey and canada i got first time flight by british airway i feel it wa the worst airline so far compared to others can you imagine that they even did not give a cup of water to the passenger for hour flight from istanbul to london they explained it by economical concern what is the economical benefit not to serve a cup of water also from london to vancouver we delayed almost hour because of luggage issue and a passenger did not feel well and he had to leave the plane which could be understandable this part but the plane wa old boeing the screen were very bad quality and small the name of the company is big but quality of the service is far below than average cabin crew are professional though so this is not their mistake it wa enough trouble for me not to select ba in my flight in the future,negative

toronto to london in premium economy easy check in and fast track security meant i wa in the lounge within min unfortunately they were clearing up and restocking from the earlier flight poor choice of stale sandwich and soup on it s last leg i let the front desk know and the staff made me a fresh sandwich also beer had changed with lager and newcastle brown the manager fetched some ipa from the first lounge some really good customer service which is typical in this lounge the most disorganised boarding ever with few pa onboard juice or water offered i asked for sparking wine but it s only done on flight from london crew explained it can t be chilled at outstation poor excuse given they do it for club and first fast service after take off with an ok entree poor salad and a nasty dry piece of cake ife wa the same a my trip over christmas so it seems the ife is updated less often tea coffee and juice offered before landing but no muffin or even a biscuit really poor prompt disembarking and bag beat me to the baggage belt return a week later wa a better flight easy check in again and no fast track queue north lounge wa an average experience ok choice of sandwich but not particularly clean and in need of a refresh bused to aircraft a boeing with premium economy only half full a half glass of prosecco wa offered and a requested top up wa forgotten fast bar service by excellent cabin crew who offered good customer service an ok meal with a rancid coleslaw ok steak and a tiny pot of desert generous with the drink unfortunately the dropping of afternoon tea at the back is inexplicable and really poor judgement by ba i wa offered t c plus a breakfast bar or malt loaf finger the crew were genuinely embarrassed a couple of sandwich i liberated from the club lounge made up for it fast off the plane and despite slow immigration the bag beat me again overall the flight wa ok but certainly not up to the standard of premium economy on competitor the meal is nowhere near club standard and it the cutting of the small thing nibble breakfast and afternoon tea which irk me the most be competitive but don t take it out on me i wouldn t mind but the price don t go down with the reduction of service despite what the ceo maintains it is not in response to customer feedback ba need to listen to what we re saying and take a long hard look at their conscious decision to downgrade service and become a bad a the budget airline eventually the hardiest of u loyal ba customer will give up and move airline alliance and that would be a shame,negative
london heathrow to stuttgart fly in comfort and style is the slogan of british airway but there is not much of either around these day not willing to pay an extra i wa allocated a middle seat right at the rear at the gate an announcement wa made for volunteer to check in their hand luggage at no extra cost within a minute a burly employee told me i had to check in my cabin bag saying you should not believe what is said on the company s website how very true some ten other passenger equally perplexed suffered the same fate i know there were ten because another employee kept counting u and saying we need ten the burly employee wa later to be found on the airbridge to make sure that we really did hand over our cabin bag all in all a demeaning experience the seat row are now more tightly packed than before although of average slim build i found the seat a tight fit only a few passenger took up the offer to purchase food or drink the deceptive upgrade we were sold at the beginning of the year but still did not reach the back of the plane until shortly before landing not only have the complimentary food and drink disappeared but also newspaper and priority boarding for those of u who are frequent flyer on the return journey i noticed part of the reason for this new policy the stuttgart ground staff have now been replaced by agency staff ba is now no better than the no frill competitor but keep the facade of a full service airline with full service price a loyal customer of many many year i will choose their competitor in future,positive

london heathrow to rome return race to the bottom my first time with the new buy onboard service i wa not happy when they announced this and this flight confirmed my disappointment basically it doe not work i can understand in some way why they decided to offer a wide range of food option i would have accepted this if they had kept the free drink even soft drink are chargeable i don t think this is acceptable however despite the extensive menu there wa an extremely limited selection available one crew member came round soon after the flight took off and took order for hot food there wa a minute wait time for this the crew then came around with the drink trolley this wa extremely slow the payment could only be made with credit card or avios point the payment added significant time to process despite sitting row from the front of the cabin we didn t get our drink until minute after they started there wa only the one trolley and they were still serving the rear of the cabin a we were starting our decent ceo alex cruz and british airway your airline used to distinguish itself from the competition but you are on a race to the bottom more row in economy abreast in some s and other cost cutting measure mean that even though i m a silver exec club member i am now considering my future travel option i live near manchester airport and klm air france and lufthansa are more attractive option,positive
edinburgh to london city despite having a confirmed booking when i attempted to check in with a prepaid for bag at at the edi airport for a flight to lcy domestic flight i wa told i couldn t a the flight had been oversold i accepted an offer to switch to a later flight on the same route with flybe and take compensation but then wa told the compensation couldn t be authorised so i had to wait i then stood around for minute being asked to move out of the way at one point because i wa blocking others i wa not given a copy of the compensation scheme detail despite what the ba website claim should be done and the staff seemed unclear of it themselves i wa simply ignored until i approached the desk again and insisted to speak to a supervisor none wa available nor could be contacted apparently i wasn t allowed to transfer to the flybe flight in case a seat became available on my original flight so they tagged my luggage but did not check it in i wa told to wait for another minute i argued this wa not fair to leave me in limbo given i had a confirmed booking in the first place but i wa basically ignored and informed this flight is regularly oversold and it s not their problem that other people had checked in before me i wa treated a a nuisance at one point there were member of ba check in staff doing nothing nobody else to serve whilst i wa just standing silently there waiting and being ignored after minute of not knowing what to do my original flight closed and i wa approached by a supervisor who suddenly wa available to talk to me and given a seat i asked how it wa that a seat ha magically appeared if earlier i had been told the flight wa already full with no seat available he explained that the seat had been prepaid for by others who had then not checked in and a the check in wa closing they could give me the seat now i informed him that i resented having been treated rudely by his staff earlier though the supervisor himself wa professional and courteous and that his staff are untrained to deal with overbookings i had done nothing wrong to deserve being treated so shabbily like a problem rather than a customer i then had a predictably stressful rush through security to ensure i wa not denied boarding at the gate for being late even though i had arrived at the airport with plenty of time to spare originally especially for a domestic flight a i told the supervisor if the airline treat it customer with such contempt do not be surprised that the public end up viewing the airline with contempt under their current policy of overbooking passenger who do not pay more to reserve a seat in advance are at risk of not getting a seat at all even though they have a confirmed booking some would call this cheating the saving grace of the experience wa that the flight wa punctual and unlike mainline ba this route is run by it subsidiary ba cityflyer which still offer complimentary drink and a snack for which the cabin crew service wa efficient i rate it out of for the stress incurred in checking in,negative

this a tale of two airline and their individual approach to business class passenger we were flying to mauritius on holiday and i felt given the flying time we should spoil ourselves and fly up front with all the comparative comfort of business class the british airway flight itself wa okay the crew friendly and the cabin worked fine however i wa totally shocked by the standard of catering in the gatwick lounge a small issue for some perhaps but for me it s all part of the business class experience to illustrate my point i attach a shot of what walsh s policy of putting shareholder first actually mean for fare paying passenger with the very confusing layout that greets one in the south terminal now that ba have moved in the serve yourself check in you even label your own bag i wa pretty frustrated by the time we actually found the lounge but then to be greeted with this wa totally unacceptable so willie rather than screwing down cost for the benefit of your shareholder this sort of display of overt cost cutting ha now lost you revenue for the future short sighted management or what take a lesson from emirate who i decided to fly home with so disgusted wa i over our experience they put passenger first,negative
london heathrow to vancouver return both flight were punctual but sadly the aircraft used are now beginning to look their plus year of age especially compared to the a s ba have used on this route the cabin is looking rather tired and worn and the seat are not comfortable enough for a hour flight i wa very pleased to have booked an exit row seat for additional room the ife system is also quite dated and limited compared to modern offering on the plus side the cabin staff were friendly helpful and courteous and this is somewhere ba seem to do well food and drink were complimentary and of decent quality for economy class boarding at yvr wa very well organised less so at the heathrow end it is also a shame that these flight depart from the cramped terminal at heathrow overall a reasonable experience but one that they could improve to excellent with a bit more polish,positive

flying british airway from paris to london is less convenient a they are the only major airline that ha the check in counter located one floor down at basement but good that on this occasion the business class lounge is relocated to the cathay pacific lounge a this caters for long haul passenger boarding on time but held in tarmac for half an hour not ba s fault the pilot tried to make up time but still failed by a few minute to have lost the allotted time so the aircraft parked a mile away with inconvenient stair deplane and coach connection but good that business passenger are taken away first in a separate car the flight is ok with snack and drink,positive
chicago to london heathrow don t waste your money buying ba seat assignment in advance i did that a month ago at the same time a i made my booking and paid for an aisle seat of my choice when i went back one week before my journey my aisle seat wa gone and i wa placed in an undesirable middle seat there wa no remedy for this five call over three day to ba connected me to people in delhi whose only vocabulary wa unfortunately sorry and just no i have been deceived lied to and put off i have flown british many time this is absolutely my last time it is acceptable to make an error but totally unacceptable to callously make no effort at all to rectify it take my advice choose another airline i am a oneworld emerald flyer on aa flew k mile last year and i can tell good service from bad british airway ha unfortunately declined badly,negative
the quality of british airway ha most certainly gone downhill on short haul from london heathrow to rome it is nothing more than that of easyjet online check in wa quick and easy and terminal is a delight however online check in is only available hour before departure unlike easyjet which allows for check in day prior to departure that wa the only good part of our journey we boarded a packed old which wa decaying with the middle seat e so narrow it wa impossible to get in and out of the seat in flight we were in row without notice we had to go through de icing which meant a min delay to our service we did however catch up min our inbound flight wa on a newer a which had better seat and a skymap due to slot restriction at rome and london this flight wa also delayed during both flight the new buy on board wa poorly done taking forever with a limited range of overpriced product i therefore can only conclude that the airline that once one just month ago offering meal on short haul flight a well a always being on time is now nothing more than a low cost carrier with older plane and a useless service what a shame,positive

the whole experience wa poor flying from london heathrow to athens ancient aircraft poor inflight entertainment and the new food offering in which you purchase your food wa very slow and lacking some of the very limited range of product on short haul and athens at hour is classified a this ba is now a low cost carrier without the efficiency of the more established low cost carrier the sole advantage is that they fly to from major airport this airline is trading on past reputation and it can only be a matter of time until a largely loyal customer base desert them for alternative airline,negative

how the mighty have fallen or should i say continue to fall my partner and i booked ticket from london to johannesburg back in september we paid approx for the economy ticket slightly more than normal a we paid for extra leg room seat it wa an evening flight and we were traveling on the relatively new a our first problem wa that our there wa not enough room for our hand luggage near to our seat so it wa placed some foot further down the aircraft not life threatening just annoying when you want to get thing out of the bag we were surprised about the lack of space our real issue wa that when it came to serving our evening meal that the flight attendant announced here is your vegetable lasagne rather than explaining that for our they were not able to offer u the default evening meal chicken or beef a they had ran out of these they made no effort to remedy the situation whether there were other choice in premium or business we will never know all i can say is that i am pretty easy to please when it come to food but wasn t happy with a vegetable lasagne so i had no meal a a result a i left the aircraft i received a text from ba asking for feedback on the flight i took the time to respond explaining all the above but received no response whilst i wa in johannesburg i tried to contact call johannesburg to complain but trying to contact and speak to anyone at ba is like trying to get an audience with pope francis i eventually received an email response stating that my complaint didn t qualify for any redress i then challenged this i explained that in a hypothetical situation whereas the passenger paid for their fare a they left the aircraft would i have been prepared to pay the full cost of the flight no and would ba if they were reasonable expect me to pay the full cost in summary i eventually wa offered credit off my next ba flight totally unacceptable a i don t fly that often even shopping voucher and an apology would have been sufficient i felt hugely disappointed with our national carrier and it s onboard service and the same for it s customer relation which arrogantly doesn t give a damn looking back the point that made me most angry wa their total disinterest in me,negative

st petersburgh to london i don t know where ba got this market research to say stop complementary meal we prefer to pay for it i ve yet to find anyone who agrees with this idea and certainly no one asked me for my opinion if you want to buy something different you always have the option in the endless airport shop before boarding i suggest they look seriously at their market research company if this is true though i suspect the real reason is cost cutting ba just doesn t want to admit it ba would be better off to admit it customer would have more sympathy than trying to promote this policy a some benefit to the customer when clearly they are removing benefit and keeping price the same we can all see through the attempted deception and it doe the image no good to tell me that charging for water or soft drink is a bargain when i can buy the same thing in tesco for p insult my intelligence they are exploiting the fact that passenger cannot carry liquid through security so they have a captive market again a great image to promote to the world where possible myself and family will now actively seek to avoid being a ba passenger where any alternative exists pay extra for checked luggage pay extra for drink pay extra for food i m sorry to see our flag carrier in such a state that it is reduced to that of a budget airline,positive
british airway is a budget airline at premium airline price flew from gatwick to cancun however if you wanted snack on a very long flight you have to buy them on board and with a long flight and meal only at the beginning and end people get hungry you do not expect to have to buy snack on such an expensive flight there wa also nowhere to plug in laptop which you expect on a long and expensive flight especially when you have work to do the plane wa also so cold too cold to concentrate on work it would take a great deal to choose them again,positive

what a disappointing experience flying british airway from london gatwick to mauritius flew club class and the service wa merely adequate they did what they had to do and no more at no point we were made to feel valued customer a request for a cup of tea after dinner resulted in no tea brought it wa allegedly given to another passenger when we had fruit a a dessert it wa given with no plate bread at breakfast wa also given without a plate had to be put directly onto the tray on the flight out the new film release advertised in the onboard flight magazine weren t available to view given that we paid a lot of money for these ticket the service given wa very poor and the flight attendant not overly friendly ba now seems to be a budget airline with regard to service and amenity but premium in price flew emirate last year to mauritius and there is no comparison emirate win hand down ba need to get it act together a it will loose customer,negative

bassinet by british airway cater for newborn only my month old son could not fit in it the only option wa a child seat however my son sleep lying flat and will not stay sleeping in the child seat the only option is to sleep on you however the arm rest are fixed in and hard couple that with the need to breast feed your child with his poor head and leg crammed in between the seat either his head would get banged on the armrest or he d kick the armrest at the other end it wa not a pleasant flight for myself or the child flying from london to hong kong other airline offer bassinet up to one year some even year and also have arm rest that see moveable so that your child is not so constrained in a tiny space for long hour imagine a hour flight with your child sleeping on you diagonally length wise because he can t fit in the seat and every so often you fear he ll fall off your lap to travel like this for any one or child is ridiculous and british airway refuse to do anything about it,negative
check in at singapore airport is carried out in a separate area away from the desk and it wa done quickly efficiently and enables you to bypass the queue to enter the terminal boarding wa chaotic after announcing family with child first and club passenger and cardholder the staff simply let everybody head towards the entrance a before the cabin crew were professional helpful and enthusiastic dinner wa served quite soon after takeoff because it wa a late evening flight it seems a shame that in it desire to cut cost british airway us tablecloth and napkin which seem a little too thin and the cutlery is slightly too small nevertheless the food wa tasty and cooked properly and there wa a good selection of wine and spirit after a couple of glass of port they made my bed and i slept soundly for several hour the seat is equipped with two usb port but these put out such little power by iphone took a long time to charge and they could not handle an ipad we landed at heathrow on time and reached terminal within a matter of minute one of british airway greatest asset is it cabin crew who in my experience are considerably better than their rival what the airline need to do is to stop attempting to save money and start giving it premium class passenger those little extra that they have become accustomed to on other airline it might have been a one off but it also need to ensure that boarding is carried out properly,positive
new york jfk to london pleasantly surprised to have experienced a nice flight on ba although the aircraft wa relatively old the seat were comfortable with a generous seat width and pitch i had a rude shock when i wa told i had to be seated in the middle seat of the middle row but it turned out alright the slack with ba is that we have to purchase a seat if we wanted a specific seat it is their way of ancillary income the ife can be improved a they have very limited offering cabin crew were extremely friendly and attentive they were tested when we had an ill passenger upon taxiing for departure they showed compassion and were professional in their service,positive

amsterdam to london a a member of their executive club and someone who ha flown with british airway time this year i now regard them a the airline of last resort the service on ba is beneath contempt ryanair used to be the source of most complaint when flying but in my experience ryanair service and punctuality beat ba with their reliance on a long lost reputation every ba flight i have taken this year ha been a source of strife and disruption from disruption in the cabin the like of which i have never witnessed on any airline other than british airway to delay on nearly all ba flight i have taken in rude surly staff that act like ba wa still a s state enterprise now when i search a flight and ba appears i shudder it is even worth leaving the uk so you get a different national airline there were even problem with the booking process what make matter worse is that british airway accept that they are wrong when making a complaint but do nothing to put matter right,negative
london heathrow to san francisco with british airway ba wa once a classy airline for their first class service amenity and food but they have succumbed to the economic pressure to the point their first class service is a lot less than it use to but the price is still absurd even using point they even hijack you for an additional or a i like to say you cough up k in point and the fee cover their real expense for you to sit in first they have jammed more seat in so the attendant have more customer the seat in spite of it new design is tighter and less comfortable for a person to do anything but sit up and watch a movie or hope they do not run out of the food selection on the menu second the staff use to be the most experienced flight attendant but the last two time i flew ba in first i had young attendant who clearly were not use to serving fc customer a request for say an additional pillow or second cup of coffee went unanswered more than once which is a sign of inexperience the last trip flying home in april i wa handed a menu with a tasting menu or a traditional menu first class wa maybe full when it wa my turn i asked the flight attendant if i could select some of the tasting menu along with feature from the traditional menu she said she would check and shortly returned to say they were out of the tasting menu item now please explain to me how any international first class service could be out of food minute after leaving the airport clearly if they do not have enough for mix or matching then this is a stingy sign of cutback on the lowest scale to save a few penny at the average price of for a first class seat ba should make damn sure first class ha all the food you need their menu also talk about late night snack and on the last two ba first class flight to the u when i wanted to try these snack they were gone a they are shared with business class the food served is both uninspiring and generally on the level of u airline first class which is cooked to death and reheated way to go ba you have sunk to the lowest common denominator third when i arrive in sf and in spite of my luggage having a priority tag it never come out in the first batch and often towards the end of the delivery so they have failed on even that count unlike the first class asian carrier like singapore and cathay where my fc luggage arrives first ba is always hit and mostly miss finally what gall me is the worthless survey they ask me to fill out describing my fc experience on ba i let them know everything i said in this review and the last question asked is would you like u to call you regarding this review and experience yes i say and not once ha someone called i am waiting for the day when ba announces all passenger including first should buy food before boarding and headset are for sale,positive

marrakech to london gatwick with british airway baggage allowance is a joke doesn t matter how much it weighs a long a bag are of a certain size but even this is not enforced or monitored by the airport staff apparently you are entitled to have one case and one piece of hand luggage to carry onto the plane however on boarding the plane there were people that had or even item of luggage which were far larger than ours these item were crammed into the overhead compartment whilst other flyer had to remove their smaller bag and put them by their foot causing an even more cramped uncomfortable space to travel in other flyer had their duty free item smashed and broken when we complained to the cabin crew they were in agreement and there wa even a manager on the flight who witnessed this and gave u his business card to use a a reference when making our complaint the customer service team a he wa also shocked by what wa going on when contacting customer service they were far from helpful even given the fact that there wa an airport manager on the flight absolutely shocking behaviour from a so called reputable airline we will certainly never be using ba again,positive

london gatwick to antigua having flown premium economy with other airline we decided to upgrade our cabin for our holiday in antigua at a cost of to british airway world traveller plus and we were told by the sale adviser that we would receive a bigger seat pitch more personal service with dedicated staff for this cabin grade better choice of meal and beverage what we received wa a polarisation of this we had very poor service and the only difference between economy and our cabin grade wa a slightly bigger seat pitch having flown long haul with ba on numerous occasion in the past i am completely shocked at the service we received it wa more like a budget airline we received a half class of bubbly prior to take off this wa quickly followed with a drink service one drink per passenger we then received our meal service i asked for white wine which wa warm not chilled and there wa no ice about minute later they served lukewarm coffee this is not the type of service i expect on any flight let alone in the upgraded world traveller plus cabin after several hour when no other drink service wa offered i went to the galley to ask for a drink for myself and my fianc to be told there were no drink left apart from whisky or red wine which neither one of u drink a the flight wasn t full i cant believe there would be a problem you just don t expect to hear this given the cost of the holiday and the upgrade that you have can only have drink on an hour plus flight hour after the dinner service we were given a sandwich and that wa the conclusion of the service aboard a flight of more than eight hour certainly not what i would expect from an airline such a ba our return flight wa in economy and the only difference wa a slightly smaller seat pitch but a this flight again wasn t full we ended up with seat between of u the service wa exactly the same a on the outboard flight ie same poor standard and for the first time ever there wa no hot breakfast before landing we were served a brick hard croissant i wa looking to book a long haul holiday to the maldives next year with ba but after this flight and the appalling customer service i received when i complained about the service on the flight when i wa told that when you pay for an upgrade your paying for a bigger tv screen and bigger seat which i certainly don t think that justifies upgrade fee if you are thinking of upgrading i would think twice about what you are paying for ba have now lost my custom and having spoken to other people on holiday i am not alone in making this decision and therefore i have booked my holiday next year with virgin atlantic ba can no longer rely on there previous good name they are cutting too many corner giving poor service and not interested in listening to their customer they need to decide if they are going down the budget airline route if that is the case they need to drastically cut the price or start to give a more professional service and raise the standard where customer feel they are getting a good service for the price they have paid,negative

the flight started in the first class concorde lounge at t it is certainly showing sign of wear with tacky material hanging down around some of the seat the seat cushion need refilling the general ambiance is quite good a refurbishment is long overdue the food quality and choice is generally quite poor although the crab tortellini wa good nobody invited u to choose from the menu or to offer drink i had to walk the floor and find someone all sloppy the menu also were worn and scruffy and someone a child i think had scribbled on the inside some funny cartoon we boarded and the flight departed to the minute all good the boeing ha a small st class and i realized that the space also is smaller than the option the alternative is a total disaster and i go to great length to avoiding flying their s food wa ok very little wow factor the meze wa fine they ran out of cod and at this point i don t think we had hit the cruise seven from eight passenger and only one cod apparently i had the lamb which wa alright but on short night flight i prefer not to have meat my wife s allocated seat wa broken hence the vacant seat on the flight so she sat one side of the plane and i sat the other brilliant the plane wa only six month old given the competition on this route you would think ba would want to impress wa it a coincidence i wonder that there wa no arabic or asian passenger on the flight with emirate on this route why would there be we landed on time and then had to walk mile another underwhelming experience with ba i wonder what those who spent one way thought,positive

gatwick to alicante crew friendly but a bit amateur for business class club europe cabin upon boarding i found my row of seat dirty with lollipop stick empty hankie wrapper newspaper and empty water bottle all strewn across seat aircraft had sat at gate for an hour since landing from glasgow why isn t it cleaned and why don t the crew check the state of the business cabin at the very least pilot came on the tannoy and said because there were meal being served we had to wait for more to be delivered this delayed the departure by minute more afternoon tea were carried on and crockery cue lot of banging and clattering in the forward galley crew only offered a drink once which i thought wa poor for a business cabin not very proactive call bell went unanswered twice i asked for a bailey and ice to round off the meal when i managed to catch the attention of purser a duty free trolley rolled back i wa handed two bag of nut instead by another cc gave up at that point,negative

london to los angeles initially late boarding a aircraft wa late on stand so cleaning could ve been better negative over and everything else wa superb the overall ambience isn t flash but rather understated elegance which you have to be british to fully understand i suppose the champagne fine wine and cognac complimented the restaurant quality a la carte meal and the service wa second to none from our geordie steward we loved the fact that one of our cabin could be set a a table for,positive
london gatwick to mauritius return our outbound flight had certainly not been memorable but new to british airway we were prepared to wait and see the inbound flight commented upon here wa much worse but with many facet of the earlier experience we paid two supplement for the flight a substantial fee to upgrade from economy and a very unpopular one to ensure a elderly client on overnight flight we could sit together the combined cost therefore wa significant the benefit were not firstly upon being seated we were faced with a cabin crew apparently in a bad mood a lady ahead of u had a headrest problem she wa rudely dealt with and seemed intimidated throughout the flight during waking hour passenger seemed to be a nuisance food a we had flown this class on other scheduled airline we were expecting a menu to select meal how silly here the economy trolley brought appalling food with a twin choice chicken or veg a bright green risotto so no choice no bread roll no cheese and bikkies a choice of one red wine and plastic cutlery this wa served after the attention in economy and may account for the absence of choice whatever it wa awful it wa noticeable how many meal remained uneaten what a waste of resource significantly better quality ha been had on holiday airline journey of shorter duration the premium economy wtplus cabin had no provision for toilet it wa necessary to go forward to club or back to economy it became clear early on that going forward wa not popular with those in that cabin so back it wa during the night with passenger debris in aisle this wa hazardous with shiny plastic bag from headphone container to slip on is nobody in british airway capable of seeing the provision of a loo for passenger is essential on arrival in uk we read that ba is to put even more seat in economy class on this type of aircraft goodbye british airway not even nice to have used you,negative
athens to london heathrow in economy class the food for a hour flight is only a sandwich for lunch drink service instead of in the old day so you better order everything you need for the whole flight british airway service keep on getting worse and worse it s a shame because the crew are actually generally friendly and nice people i will only fly getting worse and worse if they are cheaper than all the competition which they almost never are,negative

flew london heathrow to bangkok with british airway cabin looked worn and dated cabin crew were friendly and attentive disappointed with lack of snack with bar service in fact i previously flew in june and the airline always provided a fully stocked help yourself tuck box inflight meal a disappointment compared with other airline inflight entertainment satisfactory i have had better inflight experience with other non direct airline on this route,positive
london to geneva i m not sure british airway are committed to short haul business anymore and can see them going high density economy seating only a some others do business seat same a economy everyone now know about but the downgraded food lunch consisted of a small plate with a slice of ham slice of palma ham and dollop of buffalo mozzarella cheese and a bread roll and that wa that not even butter with the roll guess the value of food wa about gbp crew did their best with a poor product flight on time not worth a premium over economy ticket,positive
it doe seem that many of the negative review of british airway come from passenger travelling first or business class my wife and i flew from heathrow to los angeles and found the entire experience extremely good boarding wa efficient the seat were comfortable and the leg room more than adequate ife wa very good the food wa well it wa airline food and you cannot expect haute cuisine at ft it wa tasty enough and there wa some decent red wine the cabin crew were excellent in every way both friendly and efficient would i recommend ba to a friend yes without question,positive
we d booked to fly club world month ago turned up at st lucia to be told british airway had overbooked and we had been downgraded this is on a ticket according to the duty manager they regularly oversell the premium cabin and staff are fed up with apologising to angry passenger we were given each travel voucher a compensation so it mean we have to use british airway again we ended up in world traveller plus premium economy seat were ok but it s the standard economy menu breakfast wa a croissant which had come out of a fridge and wa disgusting,negative
our flight from london to boston wa okay disappointed to only be able to sit in middle of row of annoying to have to pay extra to have a window seat also catering on board is disappointing with only one meal plus a biscuit but crew were friendly and helpful the return flight wa different staff not particularly helpful person in front reclined seat fully and i wasn t able to fit food tray in crew member said i wa causing problem for the man in front when i requested he put his seat up to eat also armrest did not lift up leaving less than inch between seat in front and armrest meaning i wa literally trapped in my seat for hour not comfortable and unsafe in an emergency we had one drink trolley followed by a meal around an hour later staff then disappeared and only water or juice available for rest of flight will not use ba again delta and virgin flight offer much better service,negative
london gatwick to valencia with british airway boarding the flight at gatwick wa good professional and orderly ground staff at the airport were lovely and check in wa efficent onboard we got out of the gate and under way quickly seat were fine plenty of leg room back in economy although they seemed to be a little dirty when i sat down but i thought nothing more of it during the flight the cabin crew were professional doing their duty all friendly and welcoming food wise we only got complementary biscuit a little bit of a let down but on a short flight like this totally understandable drink were fine got the normal selection coke coffee juice etc on the return flight it wa slightly different they seemed to have less in stock not only in the food department but also the inflight shop disappointed in this a what i wanted to buy wasnt avaliable but on this return flight the positive outweigh the negative flight crew again amazing all kind and welcoming like the first flight overall the flight were nice well worth the money definitely would fly with them again on short haul flight through europe,positive
london to seville via madrid if you want budget airline service but decent airline price look no further than british airway i used to fly a lot with ba for both business and pleasure but lately they really started dropping the ball in i had a streak of consecutive flight all delayed by min to more than hour but that is not the worst recently i booked a flight to seville from london after a few week this flight got cancelled it took me different operator to find a solution via madrid on the same day no i don t want to fly the next day but guess what month later my outbound to madrid got cancelled a well again it took some time to find an alternative ultimately i had to settle for a hour travel time instead of hour also i need to take extra holiday and additional cost to get to my destination in seville after complaining to ba about this process i expected to get some sort of compensation after all i m an esteemed silver member their word but none of that a few phone call later i am stuck with an automated e mail service replying to me that no compensation is possible i didn t ask for any money or anything all i asked for is to waive the re booking fee if i ever have to change a flight this seemed only fair after ba cancel flight willy nilly and doesn t take the customer into account if this is the service extended to a silver member then i really don t want to know what they do to customer not part of their frequent flyer scheme,positive
british airway state that you can check in for free when i checked availability hour prior to the flight there were only three seat available for the three of u i also like to have a window seat however only available seat were aisle seat in c or j due to online check in i had only the option to select an aisle seat at t at lhr i spoke to ba customer service who advised that depending on how much you pay for the seat only certain seat will appear available in short the less you pay you get only the less popular seat with some not being available this is apparently a new policy and the staff member said it ha led to many complaint from customer the aircraft wa a reg g civv built in the aircraft had been renovated a couple of year ago and had new seat and led lighting however the aircraft table were not clean leg room wa poor and the is an embarrassment these are the word of a cabin crew member not me true the is an embarrassment when compared to the new airliner cabin crew were very friendly however were not widely seen only towards the start of the flight food wa ok veg lasagne and a nice choc mousse however only one meal followed towards the end of the flight by a fun size chocolate bar and undrinkable coffee ba wake up look to see what the competition is doing aircraft wise and sort out your unfair check in policy,positive

i have traveled with british airway many time in the past it is reliable and safe but the attitude of the cabin staff put me off it therefore came a a pleasant surprise that this seems to have changed the stewardess were very friendly and attentive the aircraft wa a boeing with a seat configuration of which wa good in flight entertainment wa very good and it worked boarding at seoul incheon airport wa surprisingly quick we departed more or less on time and got to london on time but had to do one circuit because of traffic all in all a very good experience,positive

i wa very disappointed to find that british airway are now a very middle of the road airline compared to a decade ago why firstly compared to my only other flight in an a qatar airway there are more seat crammed into the ba business on the outbound flight only of the upper deck toilet wa working and on the return flight my in flight entertainment screen wa broken which meant that it wa not visible and kept springing back to a near closed position the only possible solution the steward could find a there wa a critical bolt missing wa to wedge it with a cork which sound very flintstone for a st century airline and whenever we hit slight turbulence the cork kept popping out and removing the screen from view very annoying when you are half way through a film the flat bed and window cabin storage wa good but the beef that wa my chosen main course wa tough tasteless and quite inedible i gave up after minute of trying to cut it and chew it they did at least have a nice bordeaux red wine the staff did well enough i used to fly ba a lot and am a silver card holder but it is no longer my airline of choice,negative

london heathrow to malaga with british airway smart and clean a young cabin crew dealt well with demanding passenger drink trolley falling over and a child who insisted on standing up in his seat for takeoff just a bag of nut for a near hour flight but we all know this story yes they are reducing the service but what other form of medium long transport train ferry includes food in the deal,positive
i wa pleasantly surprised by the experience first time for premium economy with this particular airline the seat wa comfortable with ample legroom the food wa excellent for airline food and both ground staff and flight crew were friendly and efficient the flight wa quiet and smooth on time and made up time on the flight the only downside wa that the inflight entertainment stopped working after one hour despite the crew effort it could not be restored for the remainder of the flight we did note one steward enter the premium economy cabin with a list and upgraded about people into business the rest of u went without for hour it worked fine on the return journey and i guess it s just one of those thing just annoyed me that a certain selected few were upgraded and the rest ignored,positive

tokyo haneda to london and british airway is cost cutting all the time i wa extremely disappointed with the onboard catering for a hour flight there were no mid flight snack or food the tuck box vanished from your offering we got served a small breakfast at departure am tokyo time and nothing until minute before landing pretty much hour with no food so not only the food available seems to have been reduced but it is also very poorly timed it look like despite ba s good profit they are cost cutting to extreme level perhaps the ceo could try out this sector in world traveller or world traveller plus rather the the first class he probably us on a long haul flight and see how he feel at the end of it maybe he will turn a little skinnier certainly not an enjoyable or relaxing experience,negative
i had a perfectly satisfactory flight with british airway to boston and back this month oct i slept most of the way had a nibble at the food the quality of which might be declining although at altitude my taste bud are pathetic and had no alcohol the only reason i fly first class is that the bed are more comfortable than club world and i dislike the club seating arrangement apart from breakfast scrambled egg i hardly eat on long haul generally speaking the cabin crew are good and attentive and it s a bonus if you get some ex concorde crew i never want to board the aircraft early a i know that i will not have trouble stowing my bag in first a previous review complained that on the there is only one toilet in first but there are only seat all in all i use ba because from the uk i can get to any part of the world quickly with few change and in safety,positive
san francisco to manchester via heathrow marginal improvement from the outbound leg of this journey a year old a the seat were much nicer than the outbound flight seat a i did like the extra storage bin to the side of the seat by the window which freed up room on the floor can t say if that s a good thing for ba or standard on this aircraft though a it wa my first a flight that s the positive out of the way no sense of organisation to the boarding process just folk stood by a gate cabin crew looked uninterested during boarding pm departure so i wa looking forward to getting a meal and getting to sleep early to try get back on uk time a best a i could at pm meal arrived no choice offered and bit missing of both mine and my partner meal i got a bread roll she didn t she got a dessert i didn t neither of u got a drink and by gosh it wa a travesty i had the cheek to ask a member of cabin crew for a diet coke woke for breakfast after a few hour sleep and instantly regretted it a folded omelette potato wedge and a cherry tomato breakfast of king the final couple of hour wa spent watching the interactive map to see how long i had left to suffer and listening to the cabin crew in the back moaning about various thing in their personal life the minute call came from the captain and crew hurriedly prepared the cabin for landing my quick connecting flight to manchester wa pretty much the same too if i could rate thing a star i would i m ashamed british airway is my national carrier,positive
manchester to san francisco via heathrow first time flying with british airway and will most certainly be my last hour flight from london heathrow to san francisco on a very very tired looking boeing wa not what i had expected ife system wa sparse in choice and colour pixel on the screen couldn t sit with my partner a unlike most leading carrier ba opt for a system of charging if you want to reserve a seat before check in open when check in did open we were assigned seat mile apart and the plane wa fully booked so hour of no real ife and the option to talk to my partner involved a minute walk across the plane we could have opted to go with virgin cheaper but decided it would be nice to go with ba who a far a i can work out are on ryanair s level of additional charge never again british airway never again,positive
after many year of flying on ba being a gold member for the last year i have finally lost my patience with ba there is no point ba even having a customer relation team a it seems there hand are now firmly tied to be able to do anything for a loyal customer when thing go wrong i recently spent over on a flight to singapore outbound being first and inbound in club world the plane wa a fairly new a and on the outbound journey the plane developed issue in the toilet where the toilet were not be drained properly the crew on board did their best looking after thing but still wasn t a very pleasant experience from the passenger and the crew might i add on the inbound a few day later we were delayed by hour because of a pump issue in the toilet where there wa no running water throughout the entire plane must have been the same aircraft a the outbound the ground crew did everything to try and fix it because they didn t feel it wa fair departing on a hour voyage with no running water in the toilet it meant no running water to flush the toilet although the suction system still worked and not running tap to clean ourselves and of course no tea of coffee facility hour had passed and the crew decided to depart anyway the answer wa to load the plane with load of bottled water and wipe in the toilet but no tea or coffee throughout the whole journey they had to get the plane to land back at lhr just before the hour delay to stop each passenger claiming eur under the eu compensation policy the plane landed back to lhr hr min late to top thing off after landing back to lhr the ground crew from ba forgot to tell the airport ground crew of a late gate change which resulted in the bag delivery being delayed by a further hr min so in summary i get home hour later than planned with toilet issue on the outbound which created a bit of a smell around the whole aircraft and toilet issue on the way back delaying the plane and making an uncomfortable journey on the way back and seriously delaying my arrival back home with the baggage issue added to it everyone ha the right to get a decent amount of compensation in this situation regardless of the class they are travelling in the answer from ba customer relation wa avios point what s going to get me surely i ask you can do more and the lovely lady on the phone who seems embarrassed herself having to tell me couldn t do anymore a the supervisor s decision is final can i speak to the supervisor i ask i am thinking a a loyal member spending so much on ba he she might have the decency to speak to me the answer wa no they don t speak to anyone,positive
bari to gatwick yet another abysmal flight from ba no wonder the majority of passangers flying short haul these day are on package tour anyone making individual booking obviously travel with other more customer focused airline check in at bari wa resonable smooth unlike on my outward flight but the boarding process wa the now expected chaos the decision to issue hand luggage only ticket is a poor one unlike other airline no attempt appears to be made to regulate the size or weight of bag carried on board on this flight i witnessed several argument over locker space the cabin crew greeted u with bored zombie like expression meal service costed of a barely edible sandwich hastily delivered with no finesse the drink arrived a good half an hour later than the food it seems the the one aim of ba cabin crew is to provide minimum service a fast a possible to maximise the time available to gossip in the galley do ba executive never sample their economy short haul product,negative
flew jnb to ath via lhr really disappointed and expected so much more after reading previous comment have to agree that british airway standard have slipped dramatically having flown first on same routing a while back it very evident to see the cost cutting in all aspect that it definitely not worth it to pay that sort of pricing food not at all up to standard and can honestly say have had a better experience having flown business with gulf and asian carrier it a real shame a when you speak to staff on board all agree and are quite embarrassed on a positive point staff on all leg were really nice and helpful just let down by a poor product,positive
bangkok to london first time flown with british airway and the last service wa slow ife is poor to say the least compared to other airline and to be honest the last time will use them check in wa fine a done most of it online myself boarding ok on value for money i would recommend another carrier,positive
my wife and i have been flying british airway short haul in club europe for several year and until recently have been more than satisfied with the service provided noticeably this year that service ha become far more erratic culminating in an extremely poor performance and unpleasant experience on this recent flight to malta ex gatwick departure time wa and we arrived at premium check in at to find only one member of staff manning the desk serving first and club there were at least party waiting in the queue some of whom defected to economy desk which were heavily manned with faster moving queue only after more than minute did extra staff arrive and when we reached the desk the attitude of the check in lady left much to be desired robotic unsmiling and disinterested is probably a kind description it would have been good to have been informed that the no lounge wa available in the absence of the ba offering but no mention of a lounge wa made at all the no lounge struggle to cope with the additional passenger load but that is another story boarding wa fine but the in flight service from a totally disinterested cabin crew wa perfunctory at best the meal service wa late and slow with no drink of any sort offered until after all meal had been dispensed clearing the meal wa even worse the flight wa in final approach to luqa when returning from the toilet i saw one of the cabin crew sitting in the galley playing solitaire on her i pad whilst bottle and glass remained at seat which then had to be hurriedly removed a the captain announced cabin crew to seat for landing should i have apologised for being a mere passenger interrupting this lady s game session appalling and such a contrast to several lhr prg early morning flight over recent year when it ha been a joy to fly ba this may just have been a bad flight but i fear that this is the future for ba unless somebody at the top read these report and take remedial action before it s good name is lost forever,negative
flew with british airway for the first time from sydney to london return very unsatisfactory compared to premium economy experience with other airline had to pay to preselect seat and not only wa there no priority boarding the world traveller plus customer in fact were the last to board there were only row of premier economy yet wa told that the meal choice ha ran out the meal took me back to air travel in the s the starter consisted of tasteless pasta spiral and cherry tomato the fish wa dry and tasteless and the rice an unappetising grey colour the dessert wa a square of plain cheesecake hot beverage at breakfast were served in thin paper cup there wa no other service no offer of water or snack between the meal toiletry consisted of hand wash and nothing else the toilet were not cleaned and replenished during the stop over in singapore the seat wa comfortable enough but ha only a foot rest rather than the leg rest of other airline ba world traveller plus is certainly not value for money and i will not travel with them again,positive
new york jfk to london heathrow with british airway please bear in mind that this complaint concern a business class ticket customer service is non existant i could not choose seat on line called for help and wa told it wa not possible for them to do it over the phone suggested i use another browser i called a friend who could try using her pc and another browser same story unable to choose seat called airline again and wa told that it could only be done by airport staff after pressing them for the number and being assured i wa being given the contact info for ba at jfk i called only to discover i had been given the general phone number for jfk absurd i hadn t used this airline in year and never will again it s a shame they used to be such a class act,positive
i haven t flown british airway for quite a while but this journey to nice drew home to me that ba is no longer the premier airline i thought it to be trip wa okay no major problem but my point being is that it is no different to some of the many other airline i have flown such a easyjet turkish airline flybe etc cabin interior wa a bit tired i asked the air hostess for a diet coke and didn t receive one one toilet between odd people in economy isn t great on a hour minute flight cluttered galley of people waiting for the one toilet congestion in the aisle blocking the flight attendant trolley not ideal don t get me wrong the flight and airline wa okay but no different than the other lower cost airline when comparing ticket price ba no longer ha the edge for me,negative
london heathrow to kuala lumpur very poor service this is their much vaunted boeing first class could not book a massage in their lounge despite trying to book week in advance the cabana in their lounge wa smelly and had no clear partition from the toilet shower nobody bothered to check if i needed anything priority boarding wa a joke outbound service on board wa mediocre cabin crew slow to anticipate passenger need no wifi one toilet and the same size a in a low cost airline food ok but not great on arrival i asked the chief stewardess about fast track only to be brushed off with we don t do fast track here return flight wa equally poor rang the bell and no one came rang again after an hour to order breakfast stewardess came and said of course but we start serving from the other side so much for first class dining on demand the only great part of the trip wa the first class lounge in kuala lumpur thanks to malaysia airline a it is their lounge and not british airway ba lag behind air france la premi re a far a first class service is concerned,negative
travelling with british airway is always a good experience took a short break to majorca out on returning from lhr t flew out on g euyy a and back on g euxf a both excellent flight the crew were very smart and welcoming and the aircraft clean and comfortable enjoyed the lunch and bar service going out and refreshment and bar service on return noting other review it a shame people board flight hungry a their are many outlet at the airport prior to boarding even major retailer do good meal deal the crew make the difference ensuring a safe comfortable flight,positive
i cannot believe that british airway have such a meagre seat pitch on such a great aircraft i have been on many short haul flight that would have been far more comfortable let alone a hour flight to seoul i am not overweight but i am ft in tall and when the passenger in front of me reclined his seat there wa absolutely no space remaining the total lack of space ruined an otherwise flawless flight and would certainly make me check alternative airline for long haul comfort in future,positive
seattle to prague via london heathrow with british airway check in took about an hour online checkin wa not available the catering onboard is the worst from all european legacy airline the breakfast on the long haul flight wa a bad joke bread with cheese and a muesli bar on the hour flight only little chip or biscuit i talked to the cabin crew on most of the flight they encouraged me to write review because they do not agree with the company catering policy too also the performance of the crew is of a very low quality the aircraft were new that is of course more important that food,negative
singapore to heathrow british airway gave me something i wasn t expecting probably my worst long haul flight experience ever clearly ba s cost cutting measure have been primarily concerned with turning economy travel into the genuine cattle class experience they really need to up their game to compete with singapore airline and emirate who deliver economy class travel at a completely different level ba where do i start cramped seat even felt extremely small to the child and and little leg room that feel quite tortuous after hour of travel let alone the food wa laughable yes it say on the marketing blurb there are menu to choose from but it fails to mention that they are inedible i thought the child s meal of macaroni cheese would be a safe bet the grey gelatinous block that turned up made even the cabin crew blush the entertainment system just about kept the child entertained but the high hope of kiddie rucksack quality kid treat food and a warm welcome for the under s wa completely lacking if you have a choice go with another airline go with emirate,positive
london heathrow to budapest with british airway yet another abysmal flight with ba the majority of passangers these day seem to be large tour group perhaps that s why service standard and comfort resemble a s charter flight the cheaper no checked baggage ticket allowing a ridiculous kg of hand luggage cause chaos on boarding with or even people needed to lift heavy luggage into the locker consequently aisle are blocked and while these manoeuvre take place all semblance of orderly boring ha been abandoned there is no welcome on board only desparate shrieking from flight attendant to be seated quickly and to place anything small enough under the seat in front to accommodate said oversized hand luggage the seat on my flight were hard and uncomfortable cabin so called service wa nonexistant the packaged inedible offering passing a breakfast wa thrust at passangers with no finesse and accompanied by half a plastic cup of cold stewed tea the cabin staff seemed hell bent on racing through meal service to maximise time available to chat in the galley the one redeeming feature wa that the flight left on time and arrived minute early i wa only on the flight a part of a tour group booking independently i would have opted for a rival low cost carrier,negative
washington dulles to nairobi via london wa excited to fly first class on ba from dulles to nairobi since it s about hour of flying time i decided to splurge on a st class ticket thing started off poorly at checkin when ba s computer system went down a seemingly constant problem after minute of waiting they were finally able to get a back up system going and i wa checked in and off to their lounge great meal and service there my flying companion didn t want to splurge on a st class ticket so she wa in business class it wasn t long after we boarded that she came forward to report that their business class seating wa the worst she s seen ba ha this squirrelly layout where passenger sit forward and backwards on the flight meaning that you lack privacy and someone may have to step over you when you re asleep well i sprung for an upgrade for her and all wa well until the captain announced that there wa an unmatched bag on board and it had to be removed before we could depart here s where ba s system again break down and their computer isn t working to locate the bag in the hull hour later they locate the bag and we take off we land hour late at heathrow and miss our connection to nairobi no one to assist you head off to another terminal to customer service wait minute in line to be told that they can put you on a kenyan air flight business class in hour or you can wait til the next day and fly out on ba we chose kenya airway and arrived the next morning without one checked bag on our return flight i had booked a business class ticket and asked if they would upgrade me since i couldn t use my st class ticket no can t do that and you ll have to apply for a refund meanwhile they upgraded a couple of passenger gratis i wa told later that that is promotional and to hell with a paying passenger the bottom line is don t fly ba if you are going on to a distant location they are unreliable and assistance is negligible if you re just flying on to the continent where there are multiple flight you may make it,negative
flew malaga to gatwick although a better flight than two week ago the service of a small packet of crisp peanut or biscuit is a disgrace at least with other airline you can purchase food passenger were hungry and cabin staff were clearly embarrassed with the megre offering for our national carrier to go to this low base and make a mockery of to fly to serve we will choose any other airline over british airway in future human cargo are clearly an inconvenience for the ba management although the cabin staff did their very best no doubt ba management can t wait to get their hand on more of our money when they start to supply food at a charge truly shocking value and not customer focussed in any way whatsoever,positive
we were very excited about our club world journey to mauritius and how disappointed we were the food wasn t great the wine weren t either and the foot part of my flat bed kept on collapsing so i hardly got any sleep the cabin staff were good and very helpful we have travelled virgin upper class and it is much better a your bed is made up with a duvet and sheet all we got on british airway wa a sort of rather nasty blanket and no sleep suit either very disappointed in all of it our flight wa terribly delayed because the incoming flight to gatwick wa struck by lightening which is not ba s fault i know but i would have thought they could provide another plane to save having to wait so long a they have done in the past maybe they just don t have spare plane any more long haul we have travelled british airway europe several time in the past year and think this is wonderful but long haul just doe not do it for u and certainly we hope next time we go long haul we won t have to travel british airway unless they pull up their sock,positive
return journey gatwick to dubrovnik outward journey seating wa basic but were at least served a basic cardboard tasting breakfast and one drink return journey departing at noon only served either hot drink and biscuit or cold drink and small of packet of crisp i think this is slowly acclimatising people to refreshment being withdrawn completely early next year on short haul flight staff were very friendly but they must be embarrassed by the lowering of standard on british airway,negative
we recently flew british airway business class from calgary to rome via london and returned the same route like previous review we too will avoid british airway at all cost although the cabin service and staff on all of our route wa exceptional the layout of the international business class seating is brutal who design seating where you have to either bother your fellow traveler to get out or climb over their foot even worse is what british airway sell a business class within europe they are nothing more than economy seat with the middle one blocked off my husband is and i m and our knee were jammed up against the seat in front of u could you make your passenger feel anymore cramped my biggest complaint about british airway is having to pay to reserve my seat they are the only international carrier that doe this even in business class when i logged on hour in advance there were no seat to choose from and to my utter surprise my husband and i weren t even seated together shame on you british airway for being so cheap we are flying to europe again shortly and will definitely be looking elsewhere on the plus side food and service on our flight wa exceptional but your customer service leaf much to be desired,negative
london heathrow to geneva return appalling airline the booking process is dreadful they charge if you want to change seat in economy i have been told they will be charging for food and drink from january and the website very difficult to use their customer service via phone or email is abysmal they are extremely rude give completely wrong information and i have been cut off given wrong number and put through to loop message whilst some of the cabin staff are lovely many are extremely unhelpful this week a steward refused to help me put my cabin bag in the overhead locker the bag wa not oversized but i have a bad back at present and i asked him very politely yet he outright refused though he helped other people i flew club class a month ago and the fold out table wa filthy and even though the steward saw it he ignored the wet coffee ring and salt scattered everywhere and i had to actively ask him to clean it which he did but with very bad grace i avoid british airway if i can but sometimes the flight route and time fit best with my need and every single time i do fly with them i am reminded why i dislike them so much,negative
london city to malaga return thing started badly when my year old son wa out on a separate booking reference the call centre in india refused to help fix it saying i couldn t manage his booking because it wasn t in my name then we had a three hour delay at lcy something to do with them miscalculating the weight allowance during that time ba didn t give u any food or drink and gave u no update a to what wa happening we landed just under three hour late so couldn t get compensation return journey at malaga another one hour delay after we got back tried to collect avios point on website but kept getting system error then tried calling ba customer relation and after going through the menu system wa told that due to disruption your call cannot be answered that s the last time i fly this terrible uncaring airline the only upside is that london city is a great airport on a weekend,negative
come on british airway really i have flown ba long haul on two journey in the last four week first from lim lhr and now lhr den i know that ba ha refurbished some of their b and b but the rest are a disgrace a a flag carrier what message doe this send to the rest of the world on a positive note the cabin crew are always polite sometimes to the point of being passive aggressive but this is a humourless service even london underground ha moved from the dated uniform the in flight catering is lack lustre i choose vegan because the standard meal are truly awful you now even have to pay for the snack between meal unlike klm or latam i understand the economics are difficult given that some nation subsidise flag carrier but small and low cost change would make a major difference firstly smarten up the staff have you seen the lan uniform on the last flight one crew member hadn t shaved and it wasn t designer stubble get some humour training into the crew and just make passenger flight comfortable the ifs system are so dated that they match the rerun of old bbc sitcom soap offered on a positive note i believe ba is a safe airline and the crew professional big bonus point for me when there is a problem ba is efficient in sorting it out communication from the cockpit is usually good,positive
being a gold exec member and this wa a redemption flight one should not really complain but if i wa paying uk for this i would be out raged the aircraft at b well past it sell by date the crew whilst personable and very pleasent look bored the food is a disgrace wine white warm red cold so bad a when i asked for the business class menu to compare it with first wa superior in every way example being first soup versus business crab tian the csd just apologised and said i know it a disgrace but we keep telling them aircraft wa so old the ceiling fell in with the celoptape loosing it grip and some foam plate hung out it really is past a laugh asking people to pay their rate overall i find ba moving to a star it overall product is lazy apathetic inconsistent and tired the crew are fantastic in the air a for the ground well it like a tube station or a civil servant job for life atitude my advice stay well well away for premium price their euro business is laughing stock,positive
i hadn t flown with ba for quite a number of year so after seeing their new fleet i wa expecting something modern instead it wa like being in a time warp the aircraft had seen better day in my opinion and judging by the ife equipment and the inner design damaged light and uncomfortable seat it showed our nearest toilet wa out of action not good the crew were okay the service wa okay it wa just a convenient way of a to b in my opinion nothing else only until this airline manage to update everything they offer utilise aircraft wise and provide a much emphasis on their everyday economy folk a they do on their frequent flier i may consider them again value for money is negligible and after using other forward thinking modern airline the experience made the end of a great holiday feel somewhat sour,positive
flew british airway from boston to london heathrow the plane wa clearly dated judging by the old ife screen and even some rust here and there but the plane wa clean the crew were extremely nice and polite the food wa good although i would say the light meal just before arrival could have been a bit more substantial overall it wa a nice flight a note on the ground service the way it is set up with a line for bag drop among others and multiple counter that can call for this and that spread out lead to some people not hearing being called i could clearly hear the staff annoyingly saying i have called them and they are not listening so i am not doing it anymore i really think it is not nice given the distance between the counter and the line and the natural noise on an airport terminal,positive
flew london heathrow to lisbon with british airway the plane wa slightly delayed but the captain explained why and we recovered the delay on the way i believe communication to be important and appreciate the gesture the crew were extremely nice and the snack we were given wa just fine for such a short flight i am only sorry we had to take a bus in lisbon to get to the terminal,positive
toronto to lisbon connecting in london outward and stopover in london return with british airway a mix of premium economy and economy easy check in at toronto where the staff are great and the club lounge a usual wa clean welcoming and well run ok boarding with juice and water offered on boarding bizarrely no sparkling wine offered sir we only offer sparkling wine on flight from london no hot towel after take off but menu card offered one round of drink followed by dinner steak wa overcooked dry and with a greasy gravy the worst meal to date the biggest insult wa the breakfast which ha been downgraded from the muffin or nothing to a basket of smaller muffin chocolate and cereal bar plus tea coffee and juice just when you thought ba couldn t stoop any lower they manage to find something else to nickel and dime good club lounge in t with decent shower the flight from london to lisbon wa one of the best short haul flight for me a younger mixed fleet crew were really friendly offered great service and a prompt drink and snack service a tasty roll bite and a desert bite with second drink provided on request returning from lisbon a dreadful bus transfer to the aircraft a more sullen and older crew with average service with the mini savory roll replaced by sweet or savory snack shameful that ba are increasing the sugar on offer across most flight with the current diabetes debate the ba lounge on the b gate at t remains my favourite lounge with plenty of space and some peace and quiet onboard one of the old s with the old configuration with pe in front of biz class with juice water or sparkling wine offered on boarding my ife had frozen before i sat down and even after reset had a mind of it s own the safety video wa abandoned soon after starting for a manual demo a there were clearly ife issue across this aging i finally gave up watching tv a the channel kept changing no hot towel again one drink round and on asking for the little bag of pretzel i wa told they had be cut by embarrassed crew at around p a bag really a vile coleslaw starter a choice of steak or butter chicken curry which i had and a small pot of chocolate pudding completed dinner the chicken wa tasty but not a business class entree a claimed by any stretch of the imagination tea and coffee but no after dinner drink had already been cut the biggest insult in this continuing degradation of service is the scrapping of the second meal the sandwich ha gone with either cookie or single finger of chocolate with tea coffee with clearly embarrassed crew again this constant reduction in the pe product with the small stuff can t go much lower there s only the seat and space left ironically whilst in lisbon the announcement wa made regarding short haul food and drink being charged for in economy ba are being disingenuous to suggest that people are asking for improved catering yes they re asking because you ve cut the service back so much in the first place i d pay for a decent m s sandwich but i enjoy my free drink charging for tea coffee and juice even air canada haven t stooped that low i really worry for ba s future the drive to improve the bottom line ha gone too far i don t see fare being reduced to reflect the reduced service the board of ba iag group and their shareholder should be ashamed and embarrassed with themselves a the demise of the uk s flag carrier continues,negative
flew british airway to from heathrow recently a first experience have read a number of previous review commenting about the indifferent attitude of cabin service i absolutely agree and what a shame but ba if you actually read some of these review you can actually retrain and improve our perception quickly when boarding rather than just pointing to which aisle to begin walking down actually have your cabin staff positioned even in economy to assist passenger struggling to load carry on baggage and to get seated and out of the way of others many of u are unfamiliar with the somewhat different control on the newer s perhaps a handout a we board or a bit of cabin assistance on long transatlantic flight cabin steward disappear for at least hour mid flight perhaps an occasional trip down the cabin once every hour or two to ask if customer need anything or are they fearful of the extra work,negative
we frequently use british airway morning flight from boston to london and will again but the reduction in the quality of food served in economy is startling the english breakfast choice wa a pleasant surprise until this last flight on which the reduction of portion size and quality wa noticeable the pre landing snack had always been a decent chicken salad sandwich but on this flight it wa a cookie maybe two i forget the cabin crew wa efficient and friendly and the avod wa excellent much improved from the older s which we have had on the route beware however fast track security at heathrow which twice in the last six month ha been glacial no better than regular line,positive
new york jfk to d sseldorf via london heathrow the online check in wa fast and easy the choice of seat free of charge wa very poor even the plane wa half full the check in baggage organization in jfk wa a mess long line with no priority for member you should arrive min hour before the boarding otherwise you will miss your flight the staff in the plane more less accabtable my hand luggage got misplaced in the plane i think somebody just remove it i asked the staff and at least they found my hand luggage recommendation to ba staff behaved partly unacceptable beverage and seat comfort in total okay,positive
quite simply next time we fly and where possible we shall use any other airline with one exception being south african airway rather than british airway flew from johannesburg to london heathrow the seating in business on the a is dire and the description given by another reviewer that it feel a if you are in a coffin is pretty accurate the staff were just about acceptable but they appeared indifferent and just going through the motion of serving the food and beverage whilst trying not to look too bored whillst doing their job oh and my tv packed up and froze so i wa unable to watch or listen to any music for half of the journey the qantas business class seating is superb and just how all the other airline should configure their seating on the a shame they don t fly to south africa although if they did it would be impossible to book a seat a everyone would choose to fly with them and not british airway,negative
london heathrow to bergen took off and landed on time sandwich on the outbound flight wa good with plenty of drink on this short flight return flight crisp offered again with plenty of drink a full flight seat hard but okay service good on both flight ticket expensive for two but got it down to with avios point i only booked a week before flight,positive
london gatwick to mauritius i never in my life had a flight a bad a this one my husband and i were flying to mauritius for our second anniversary from gatwick airport the staff were rude and inattentive i pressed the flight attendant button so many time and after waiting min they just switched it off however that wa not the worst of it the flight wa so cold we asked if they could please turn it up they didn t care multiple passenger asked for extra blanket not that it would help i wa literally shaking the whole flight through even though i had multiple layer of clothes on i will never fly direct to mauritius with british airway i paid more for a direct ticket than a indirect flight but thanks ba for letting me realise paying more doesn t equate to better service,positive
paris to bangkok via london what a mistake to choose ba for this business class flight the experience of the seat with their weird coffin like configuration sliding screen and people climbing over me almost continually wa enough to say never again the service wa very patchy with some decidedly long faced and size challenged cabin staff coffee undrinkable and forget having a choice main course near to inedible but the portion were thankfully miniature the wine selection wa good but my unsmiling stewardess told me there wa no bordeaux only merdock i should have explained that medoc is a bordeaux region but really this simply come nowhere close to thai emirate or cathay singapore airline is in a league way way ahead i should add that the lounge in paris and london were great paris wa a share with cathay and london s terminal lounge wa excellent shame about the flight and the quite hideous seating tight face to face with a complete stranger noisy and hard,positive
absolutely dire they were installing a new check in system which failed huge queue at check in and we had to ask to be taken out of the line or we would have missed our flight despite arriving well in advance they then lost our luggage both mine and my partner and they didn t even get it on the glasgow flight the luggage took day to arrive in zurich that s day from a day break that we had to stay in waiting on luggage their online information service didnt match what we were told verbally on the phone and the people we spoke to were irritable rude and unhelpful we submitted a formal complaint on our return via ba website it took them over week to reply and when they did they accepted no responsibility and gave u a list of excuse about how they had a new check in service that wa causing problem in london totally irrelevant to the problem in glasgow an appalling company and gone are the day where they had a good reputation for looking after customer unlikely we will ever fly with them again unless there is absolutely no other option,negative
here i am again after my previous review week ago of specifically the british airway online check in system i am currently in cyprus on holiday and will be flying back to london this evening with my elderly mother we sat next to each other last night at and opened our ba apps on our phone at the same time my mother had a choice of seat on a seat boeing and i had a choice of just seat again so clear evidence of passenger inequality at ba even though the passenger are travelling in the same cabin class this happened week ago when flying from london heathrow to larnaca firstly why do i who fly several time a year with ba only get very poor location seat to choose from and another ba economy passenger get a choice of seat to choose from secondly why do ba offer an online check in service which is not fit for purpose when i fly with aeroflot you can choose your seat at the time you actually book your ticket a it should be with every airline but ba appear to suffer from some kind of seat hoarding issue for some reason i presume they would rather people pay the to choose a seat in advance on top of the already high price of their ticket something i personally will never ever do,negative
singapore to london heathrow with british airway the wa our first experience on ba s a and it wa very comfortable and relaxing we usually fly etihad from australia to lhr but this time decided to try ba the boarding at singapore wa efficient friendly and on time a this wa a late evening flight we just wanted to get settled and into bed a soon a possible we made this point to the crew and they were fantastic in making this happen a soon a they were permitted to set up the bed the config of first class in ba is with aisle this is not a good a the etihad first which ha a central aisle with individual cabin called apartment of the aisle never the less the seat were fine for flat bed sleeping if a little narrow the staff were very professional and did not bother u until breakfast time breakfast wa just ok with limited option but this wa ok for u the a is clearly the benchmark in long haul first class flight and on this occasion ba provided a high quality service,positive
san jose costa rica to gatwick with british airway i wa very unhappy with this flight the seat were uncomfortable the plane wa old and the tv screen were scratched and appalling to watch there were drink service the whole hour flight not including the meal which were worse than usual we couldn t get up and walk about a the seatbelt sign wa on for extended period i didn t think there wa much turbulence i ve had worse the crew disappeared for extended period of time british airway are obviously running on the cheap whilst trading on it previous good reputation this is unacceptable compared to the dreamliner which also ha game usb charging port new film and drink on demand this is vastly inferior and i will never travel ba again,negative
heathrow to bangkok with british airway fast check in by friendly staff at lhr the gallery lounge wa a always were busy but seat were comfortable and the food ok boarding started approx min before departure with boarding through l unlike most of the middle eastern airline we were just pointed in the general direction of our seat rather than shown to them aircraft wa an older in a cabin configuration and the age wa showing and while generally clean the trimming wa coming apart the ife screen were small and the seat felt a bit cramped very much like virgin atlantic s upper class seat these were great for sitting normally or fully flat but everything in between wa a struggle and the ying yang seat configuration is akward to say the least but the centre seat are great if you travel a a couple welcome drink were eventually served and we took off only slightly delayed dinner wa painfully slow and it wa a good hour after take off before dinner wa finished starter and dessert were ok but the entree wa far too overcooked for my taste also there is no dine on demand facility you eat what you are given when it suit the crew the crew were friendly but painfully slow it also took more than an hour after dinner before the cabin light were fully dimmed breakfast wa served hour before landing and the crew were transformed it wa a quick and efficient service a shame it took them hour to get to that point breakfast wa not great but edible we landed at bangkok on time but no fast track card for immigration were given bag arrived on the belt only minute after we had passed through immigration it is clear that ba have been cutting cost in their premium cabin and it show in spade when compared to the middle eastern the asian airline and even the u airline they could benefit from cutting the very generous bagage allowance and use the money saved on fuel on getting a new hard product seat and cabin and improving their soft product food service etc especially given their current price point based on review here i had set my expectation of ba low and i wa still disappointed,positive

san jose london heathrow san jose in september in premium economy wa so excited when british airway announced the new san jose service earlier this year driving up the to sfo had become a tedious task with traffic getting more and more congested so wa relieved to book out of sjc a ten minute drive from home my only one gripe with ba is not being able to select a seat at time of booking without paying an additional fee which should not be necessary in premium economy night before travel i wa unable to select a seat during on line check in so next day i proceeded to the airport only to be told no seat wa available due to over booking wa provided an compensation credit card to fly the following day which i gladly accepted the boeing is a beautiful quiet airplane and a good choice of aircraft for this route wa given juice upon boarding and a hot towel only one drink service after take off and only one shot of whiskey wa provided dinner service included a choice from the club world cabin menu full english breakfast prior to landing return trip given glass of champagne upon boarding and hot towel lunch wa a filet of beef mid flight snack box wa a let down and afternoon tea included a pizza cabin crew were ok and nothing exceptional on both sector overall a good trip,positive

london gatwick to new york jfk with british airway check in at lgw is a complicated slow process but once through security thing get better i dislike their business class seat layout old aircraft very worn out seat with little or no padding but the excellent cabin crew made up for all of this they were going out of their way to serve to make sure every passenger wa comfortable well fed and plenty of drink food wa good flight on time but arrival at jfk is chaotic long immigration line etc,positive
we flew from heathrow to ko on tuesday th september departing at a the flying time wa between and hour long we had contemplated flying club europe but with identical legroom to the economy seat it didn t seem worth the money we checked in around and having previously paid to reserve our seat everything went smoothly a most of terminal seemed very quiet i had tried to find out in advance what food if any might be offered on the flight a we would have preferred not eat breakfast at in the terminal however despite knowing people that work for british airway it seemed quite difficult a the web site is rather ambiguous having said that i did find out that the food offered depends on what band your flight is classified a but try a i may i couldn t find the lhr to ko on any of the band in the end we had tea and toast at gordon ramsey s which wa expensive but a lot quieter than the other outlet serving breakfast boarding wa on time although we did have to catch a bus to somewhere near terminal three which took around minute the plane seemed little more than half full which obviously speeded up boarding and we left a little early the cabin crew were polite friendly and efficient and we were offered a sandwich and a drink for breakfast which wa fine a we had a spare seat in our row of three it effectively meant that we had the same space a club which made the flight a little more comfortable we arrived a little early in ko after a slightly bumpy landing but we were through custom and had our bag within half an hour overall a good flight and ba must have a tough job selling their club europe seat unless of course passenger want to pay hundred of pound for lounge access and a hot breakfast,positive

abu dhabi to london british airway is usually a very organised airline they do have a stuffiness and it irritates that we need to pay for selecting any seat even if we fly business class this is something that i and every sensible person would consider a utter madness i did not pay a penny and managed to get an aisle seat for my auh lhr leg on my trip boarding wa chaotic although this is nothing to do with ba but it the airport mess staff were polite and efficient and we landed ahead of time on departure we were given a light snack and before arrival a full english breakfast overall a comfortable flight,positive

abu dhabi to heathrow return probably one of the worst flight travel experience me and my family have had to endure from what wa supposed to be a joyous occasion for u a a family taking our daughter to the uk to get settled into university turned into an experience that will make sure that we never fly british airway again first when checking in in abu dhabi the flight wa cancelled due to technical problem with their new boeing of course flight get cancelled and we fully understand but what wa rediculous wa the total lack of communication passenger stood around for hour with no one knowing what wa going on eventually a check in clerk told the passenger to come back the next day at am for check in the actual flight time wa then the plane wa delayed yet again british airway staff were no where to be found eventually a supposed british airway manager arrived we then couldn t check in because the system wa broken after an hour they decided to manually check u in and we were away to get our daughter settled in uni arriving at heathrow two hour to clear custom because they were short staffed then on to collect bag only to find that my daughter bag for uni wa missing apparently never made the flight and no one know where it is again no communication from british airway despite several call to them each day and the crazy thing is that you have to repeat the story to every service centre person that answer the phone sad thing is that in the move to uni she had packed a few sentimental item into her check in bag when we explained this to the ba phone operator she wa told that wa probably not the wisest decision thank you ba for the great advice now sitting on the plane returning to home to abu dhabi same plane day later and the plane is delayed again due to hydraulic fluid leaking from the engine great you found the leak but a new plane all these problem seriously british airway should you not test your new aircraft before you haul passenger around the world,negative
gatwick to malaga aircraft on remote stand at gatwick north terminal requiring a shuttle transfer and boarding via step without cover not bad this early am a just overcast but dark and chilly waiting to board aircraft in poor state of preparation with stain on back of seat leather and generally dirty pushback delayed due to late arrival of passenger who missed shuttle minute delay in departing due to aircraft movement volume that lead to two female passenger having argument that lead to csd threatening to return aircraft to stand with one passenger being moved well dealt with by cabin staff very noisy group of male on golf holiday in seat to rear of row who consumed alcohol the entire journey becoming very loud using foul language spoken to by other passenger and told to desist the food just get worse each trip i fly with them muesli high in sugar and cheese croissant tasting worse than cardboard is this really the best they can do finally to round off flight a very hard landing to conclude one of the worst short haul flight i have ever taken with ba cabin staff great but product is poor,negative
on a flight leaving at the advertised snack consisted of a choice of crisp a two biscuit pack or a very small packet of nut these and a drink in a small plastic cup were served with no finesse possibly the cabin crew were embarrassed by the lack of anything more substantial british airway need to decide whether to improve food offered on short haul flight or to have reasonably priced good quality snack available a do their low cost competitor,negative
one way london heathrow to amsterdam with british airway flight itself wa good food tasty and staff friendly this is a short flight and the flight attendant have a lot to do in a little amount of time so they can be forgiven for being seemingly hasty the only complaint is the incredibly crowded lounge locker in the lounge would be a great improvement especially for solo traveler,positive
flew from london heathrow to seattle poor boarding procedure at t with the indicator suggesting flight wa not ready to board but on arriving at gate we walked straight on passing others who were waiting and seemingly not sure whether to board or not econ seemed about full sat half way down but told no choice available for main meal which wa served after about hour of taking off cabin crew very apologetic and blamed management for recent cost cutting measure saying this is happening a lot and upsetting many passenger travelling with child who didn t like the only option offered so much frustration with british airway taking a budget airline approach but charging all full service price complained to customer service after arriving home and wa told the caterer at lhr wa to blame and they didn t want to delay the flight waiting for the extra meal seems a bit lame and complete contradiction to what the crew said crew made an extra effort to bring a few snack from business to my child which wa highly appreciated hard to recommend ba but given the competition on this route and the desire to stay with one world ba ffp it s a poor choice,negative
london heathrow to budapest it seems british airway ha lost so much of it traditional customer base that it s turning into a budget airline at scheduled price i only fly with them now when tour operator give me no choice ground staff were the now usual bunch of job worth refusing to change my seat because that s what the computer ha allocated boarding wa the now expected shamble the no checked baggage fare option result in so many oversized bag being carried on board that overhead space for small case is at a premium on this flight several were removed from locker and the owner rudely told to put them under the seat in front thus severely restricting leg room cabin staff were rude and uncaring again now the norm for ba the in flight snack wa a soggy croissant and a small plastic cup of tepid stewed tea the seat are very narrow allowing minimal room a no space between neighbouring passenger,negative
i am a regular traveller on many airline and a one world emerald ff british airway flight ba from lhr to athens on th september wa by far the worst cabin crew that i have encountered in year of flying the crew had no interest in the interest of passenger in business class and were more interested in chatting with each other in the galley area after hour in the air we were offered a drink the champagne wa undrinkable and the crew gave me a gin and tonic after that they did a meal service and served a fish dish that had been overheated and again wa inedible that wa all the service we received on the whole flight of hour no top up of drink no offer of water and again the cabin crew spent their whole time in the galley eating and talking i even went out and asked them wa there any service on this aircraft and received no reply,positive

miami to london heathrow with british airway in first class the boarding process at miami wa chaotic with the staff member inviting world traveller plus club world and first class to all join the queue to board despite flying first class it took minute to get to the front of the queue and a further minute on the jet bridge before getting onboard the crew were indifferent and we were not escorted to our seat the hot towel service before take off wa a cold dry towel which had not seen any hot water the hot nut were served minute after the drink the meal wa dry and of poor quality the cabin crew forgot my partner main course and put one in the oven minute after everyone else had eaten and when it wa served it wa cold and inedible when the crew member made my bed up i wa informed they had run out of duvet and the crew only managed to find one after i complained about the poor experience to the csm based on this experience ba s penny pinching across all of the cabin ha lowered the quality of all of the product and it is not worth paying for first class save yourself some money because united airline economy class is better than what i experienced on this flight,negative
we flew a a group of from heathrow to krakow in club europe the aircraft wa clean and newish so had the new economy seat in the club section i would like to know who at british airway sanction the use of these tiny seat in club i know it nice to have the middle seat blocked but i would prefer a bigger seat to sit in maybe ba should have a look at turkish airline biz cabin the service outbound wa just adequate one drink round then a dinner service ba which wa edible but slopping dumping the meal out of a heated plastic container into a china dish in front of the passenger lack some grace to say the least are the crew trained to do this or wa it just bone idleness not to prepare the meal in the galley then serve to the passenger in all the outbound journey wa just about passable but not comfortable given the seating now for the return what a joke nn lounge at krakow that s right you squeeze onto the end of that overcrowed bench by the gate and keep quiet the flight wa delayed by nearly hour so by the time boarding started it wa a scrum priority boarding abandoned to get through the gate a most passenger were so fed up british airway prefer not to pay for airbridge access to the plane so we were then treated to a nice ride in an old banger bus crammed to the gill with sweaty fed up passenger all trying to avoid other people armpit once on the plane the same tiny seat although we were winner all round a we managed to bag a and c so at least we had some leg room the meal service on this leg really did make me giggle the steward offered a shriveled chicken salad leg meat skewer or get this a boxed sandwich i actually had to ask if that wa it he replied yes to which i replied so who s eaten all the food he laughed and actually said we were lucky and if i had any food with me could he have some and i m not making this up once at lhr it took h for the bag to turn up by which time the pod service to the parking had stopped and that turned into a complete drama but i won t go there on this ocassion so what did we get for our club fare to krakow in my opinion very little and what we did get wa rubbish if anyone is thinking of going to krakow with ba my advice is save your money and fly economy with another airline and spend the saving having fun there in fact choose another airline since ba on this route are just a joke i have been club europe hundred of time over the last year and the gradual decline in the product ha now just about reached the point where once i have used up my k avios it ll be bye bye ba for good i will only use avios to get first long haul a that get you the best return on them,positive

london to johannesburg return still waiting for a reply after attempt via email post and phone to make contact on flight ba to johannesburg the inflight service wa the worst we have ever experienced we took off around h and were only offered a drink at h this wa the only drink offered that night dinner wa served at h no drink accompanied this we were surprised to see we were sitting in the back row of the plane which wa not what wa shown on the diagram when we booked and paid extra for selecting our seat when we made the booking we did not have a choice of meal a they had run out all we were offered wa a very poor excuse for a mushroom risotto which wa inedible it took over an hour for the tray to be cleared away breakfast wa served to the special diet around h waking the entire section where we were seated then the light turned off for another hour until we were offered an equally horrible breakfast coffee wa not offered at all the amount of liquid offered wa below minimum requirement if we had not taken our own water with u we would have had a problem when we departed the plane it look like a rubbish tip no waste had been collected during the flight the cabin staff were surly and uninterested prior to this flight we tried to avoid the back of plane issue by paying an additional for exit row seat the payment wa accepted and receipt issued via email when we went to check in online our original seat had been allocated again when we arrived at johannesburg airport we were told that the seat were no longer available and had been allocated to other passenger no apology or explanation wa given not the way we wanted our holiday to end the service on this flight wa a to be expected regular drink offered water throughout the night the only negative being no choice for dinner and a poor breakfast cabin staff were very good we have not received a refund for the paid for the exit row seat and i await an explanation a to why these seat were not allocated to u even though we were flying economy we expect a level of service and edible food if the back row are to receive less or no choice on food and drink then they should be charged less this is unfair and bad business practice upon speaking to other people who have flown with ba the general consensus seems to be that only first business class passenger seem to be valued and our experience confirms this ba were not the cheapest flight by far we opted to fly with them due to reputation which wa sorely let down,negative
british airway is getting worse online check in what s the point if you cannot choose seat no warm food on any of my recent flight except transatlantic yet the price still don t reflect this moreover when i asked for a warm tea a well a a can of coke on board the flight attendant looked like he wa doing me a favour for giving drink a opposed to just one at least i didn t take the crisp offered to me always late when flying in or out of gatwick which might be due to the airport,positive
london heathrow to larnaca i went into the british airway app on my phone second after online check in opened and totally disappointed to see only seat available to choose from this is the second time this ha happened with british airway in the last few month who really should not be offering an online check in service if you not given a reasonable choice of seat selection i called them to enquire why they do this to which the reply wa that most seat are restricted on online check in they did sort the seat i wanted however a i m flying with my mother who obviously i want to be sat next to yet when i looked yesterday at the option of paying for a seat reservation before online check in open there wa a good choice available if british airway really want to charge extra for choosing a seat and make it almost impossible to have a seat choice for those not paying then they should abolish the online check in a it s clearly not providing the service it should do online check in mean being able to choose from several seat not being unacceptably limited to seat choice only just second after online check in ha opened,positive

i have to be upfront and say the flight from london heathrow to boston exceeded expectation mainly due to the cabin crew over the year british airway first ha gone so far downhill i m afraid it just can t compete anymore it needn t be so a the issue a i see them are all resolvable however the return leg wa like flying with ryanair there were only people in the cabin there were no slipper of the menu item i requested were in the word of the crew invisible and what did arrive wa verging on inedible due to sauce being lumpy and near to warm the chocolate lava cake contained no lava and quite how one can burn and cool food at the same time is beyond me my father waited the entire flight having asked on seperate occasion for a headset convertor we were not asked if we wanted to be woken for breakfast which i then missed assuming i would be woken there wa a palpable tension between the crew which wa confirmed on leaving the flight when we overheard a member of the crew comment he wa happier to get away from the crew than the passenger once we had disembarked the aircraft it wa a further minute before we could get in to the airport a a door had not been unlocked finally we collect our suitcase which i have to say were present when we arrived at baggage reclaim only to find of the had broken wheel ba have subsequently supplied new replacement suitcase when comparing the service food to virgin uc for usa and etihad first for east bound ba just doesn t cut the mustard any longer i m afraid such a shame a the seat bed are great but why pay the extra for service and food that just isn t forthcoming or varies from flight to flight,positive

the british airway experience ha really declined over the past year i often fly business class and at least premium economy the boeing is awesome clean spacious and excellent technology medium option however the staff and service ha declined rarely do the staff seem interested in their job they are on automatic pilot we travel with child and the stroller ha become a real problem firstly they gave a kg maximum on weight try getting a kg stroller that work in canadian weather so we bought a new light stroller however we have noticed extreme wait time to have the stroller brought to the gate after a flight end try travelling with a year old through the chaos of terminal in the summer month without a stroller with a tight hour lay over we waited over minute for our stroller the only reason we got it ground staff forgot wa because the older and very caring pilot went down the stair himself to get it the younger staff could care less and left u and other family alone waiting they could learn a lot from the pilot also every single flight on our journey ended up leaving hour late a mixed blessing we made our layover because of it the good in the lounge and on board ha suffered a well anyway they have to improve i fly with family member every year to italy this time we are using klm or lufthansa and another bonus u we can avoid heathrow terminal,positive
flew malta to london first the plus point generous luggage and hand luggage allowance even more so by being one world sapphire member which also allowed pre booking of seat including emergency exit row at no charge and lounge access so far so good but new style leather seat whilst smart looking are hard after hour flying without the ability to recline no entertainment apart from ba in flight magazine and inflight shopping magazine what really let british airway down though is the food and beverage service one albeit fresh sandwich and a drink no tea or coffee service and the crew fast became invisible after the meal had been served the flight wa crowded too meaning that overhead luggage space wa at a premium a the negative effect of a generous hand luggage policy came into play on the basis of this trip ba ha declined significantly since i last flew with them offering a very basic level of service,positive

london heathrow vancouver london heathrow first impression could have been better a this flight departs from terminal rather than terminal at heathrow the departure lounge wa being used by multiple longhaul flight on large aircraft meaning that the area a crammed full with most passenger having to stand and making it difficult to access the departure gate however the ground staff did their best to manage the situation and were clearly used to having to manage it once on board i found the cabin to be very clean unlike many airline ba offer economy seating upstairs on the a where the ride is noticably smoother and quieter than on most other aircraft however the profile of the cabin mean that the overhead locker are smaller than usual which could be an issue for those with roller case the ife system provided is excellent i also ordered one of ba s new gourmet meal offering rather than take the standard meal this option wa well worth taking up offering an improved choice and quality the service provided by the flight attendant wa friendly and professional and this is one area where british airway seems to do consistently well if i have a criticism it is that the inch seat pitch seems miserly for a hour flight arrival at vancouver wa on time and i wa through immigration and landside in about minute processing through security for departure from yvr wa equally efficient the return flight offered a similar experience to the outward one although arrival in london wa an hour late however the relatively quiet cabin on the a meant that i wa able to get some sleep unfortunately the arrival experience at lhr terminal wa no better than the departure one a lengthy walk to arrival concluded with having to join a slow moving snaking line to clear immigration a marked contrast to the experience at yvr,positive
flew london heathrow to washington dc the business class cabin on a british airway a is unconscionably crammed with seven seat per row most other international carrier i ve flown limit themselves to no more than four or at most five seat per row in business class in the ba configuration passenger in the middle of each row are trapped in their seat if their seatmate choses to extend their seat into a flatbed also the seat lack any storage space save a tiny drawer suitable for no more than a pair of shoe and the seat are claustrophobically narrow by far the worst business class seat i ve ever encountered,negative
i fly this route time a year unfortunately there is no competition other than air canada i ve had occasional problem rude staff freezing plane poor service but generally been satisfied on this last flight a week ago the plane ha been internally reconfigured and they have placed large metal box in the foot area of every third seat that take up approximately of the space and fully restrict the movement of your foot and therefore your leg for the entire journey if you are a normal sized adult i have attached a photo of my foot trapped in this space i offered to send ba this photo but apparently they are not interested a they ignored the offer along with the content of my complaint see below the discomfort caused by the reduced foot space wa compounded by a delay of hour for which i did not blame the airline meaning i spent hour in that position rather than hour then on arrival we in steerage learned that the pre landing snack had been replaced by a funsize chocolate bar approximately inch in size a a result i arrived starving and had to go and eat somewhere after pm and would have brought food on the flight had i known of the miserly cost cutting measure in advance i wrote to complain about these aspect of the flight but primarily the lack of foot space because of the new configuration a this can t easily be remedied and will put me off using the airline again i ended my complaint saying i had the distinct impression that there is no respect for economy traveller i ve just received a response which is clearly a cut and pasted reply about the hour delay and completely ignoring the content of my complaint indicating that it wa not even read and confiming my impression that they have contempt for the experience of people in economy which is particularly shortsighted a some of u will soon be travelling in higher class due to change in our circumstance and we won t forget how we were treated,negative

flew london gatwick to tampa ba club world business class is a great way to travel unfortunately due to renovation at lgw british airway are having to utilise a lounge so it wasn t a restful a may otherwise have been but once complete i m sure that standard will be resumed on boarding it wa nice to be welcomed back a small but nice touch straight after settling into our seat came complimentary drink warm towel and our menu choice ba doe a great filet steak and the dessert were fantastic one of the thing i really love about ba is the fact that they have a diverse age range when it come to their cabin crew the more senior member really do know their stuff the thing that only experience give you and this flight wa no exception superb service wa provided by the cabin crew and even when stretching my leg they were quick to offer refreshment and guide me to the galley where a large selection of snack drink are available between the regular drink meal service the only downside for me are the seating arrangement that mean that those in window or centre seat have to step over other passenger when those passenger are fully reclined and the ife which really doe need an update i know that the second point is being addressed on the older aircraft a an aviation enthusiast a really big thing for me is that the flight deck crew are always ready to spend some time chatting after the flight ba my airline of choice,positive

glasgow to kuala lumpur via heathrow british airway get bashed a lot and i get why they don t have the best seat they don t have the best food they don t have the best cabin etc they don t seem to be the best at anything the business class lounge in lhr are often very busy the food isn t very good although they provide a load of free pouring alcohol the club world cabin on the boeing is very nice place although a bit crammed the cabin design and atmosphere retains a feeling of class in term of the club world seat it ha it critic but i like it the separate footrest is one of the best feature for making a comfortable seating position and it one of the only airline seat i can sleep in this may in part be due to knowing there aren t many thing to distract you from sleeping such a a bar area or a huge range of film on the ife food wise it an o affair the dish are ok although you only get the choice of dessert or cheese not both how cheapskate i have always found cabin crew to be experienced highly competent and keen to help they make the difference i know when i get a ba flight i will be looked after just not spoiled,positive

bengaluru to london heathrow with british airway in world traveller started badly at check in and gate boarding world traveller passnegers are made to feel second class citizen but this seemed worse at bengaluru choatic than heathrow the plane itself wa packed to capacity probably because this is the only direct carrier on this route world traveller is a x x configuration i had chosen an aisle seat in the centre seat d at the rear to minimise risk of disturbance from other passenger leg room is actually pretty good for economy and the new style of seat ha plenty of space underneath seat width is ok the adjustable headrest is better than that in premium economy world traveller plus although the seat base is hard for a hour flight i recommend sitting on the cushion service wa variable the vod in my seat did not work all i could get wa the map and one of the staff reset it quite grudgingly i felt time without success thankfully a more senior staff member wa able to find the only other unoccupied seat about hour after takeoff to be expected to put up with a seat without vod for hour is ridiculous why do ba not check them after each flight plenty of food breakfast after hr in then a snack box after hr then lunch after hr but unfortunately while i thought sitting at the rear would mean being served first that wa not the case and by the time they got to my row all choice wa gone no connectivity in seat only earphone socket vod choice quite limited compared to other airline unfortunately i think that british airway have been overtaken these day and will look to the middle and far eastern carrier in future,negative

sadly british airway business class london heathrow to geneva is no longer worth any extra cost i m only cm and can t sit comfortably and relax without being sideways in addition to chamonix we have home in london and telluride colorado and ba lost u a customer for quite a few year on the lhr to den service again because of the ridiculous seat forward backward seat configuration in business class that requires u or someone else to climb over u to get out of the seat during the flight therefore we flew air nz much much better flight if a little inconvenient to lax return flight a year and suffered longer on united to get to our destination a ba business wa so bad fortunately they now have a on the lhr to den service where we can fly first class which we are using but it would only take another airline to do this route for u to move away from the ageing cabin staff and extremely average service,negative
british airway flight from amsterdam to london in an airbus nothing special about this club europe seat and legroom are similar to economy class but they do not sell the middle seat in business i would not buy a business class ticket for only club europe it is not worth it i do not understand why everyone is so excited about the lounge at t this is the third time i have been there it wa packed with family with screaming kid and you almost have to fight for a seat that can not be the purpose of a business class lounge onboard we quickly found out that this wa a very old plane dirty carpet and torn upholstery on the seat food wa poor dirty cutlery that we had to keep if we wanted a dessert i took a glass of wine with my dinner when i asked for a second one i wa told that they were out of that one finally after fifteen minute he came back with a new bottle the crew did not make u feel that we were valued customer in business class ba club world is not value for money,negative

flew economy class from manchester to johannesburg via london heathrow with british airway flight from manchester to heathrow delayed for over hour very crowded waiting area we had paid extra for emergency exit seat chosen before departure only available exactly day before flight this wa well worth the money paid the emergency exit seat meant we had no one sitting in front or either side of u giving plenty of room to stretch out for an overnight flight again we had paid extra for upgraded meal and these were very good quality well presented with proper cutlery also served before the rest of the cabin enabling u to then stretch out and relax good entertainment system all the advantage of premium economy without the price we had the same service on the way back without the prebooked meal a these are only available from heathrow dont know why it s not available both way a the meal is basically what they serve in first class having used virgin to fly to jamaica for last year are now going with ba into kingston hoping the service is a good only disappointment wa with the return connecting flight to manchester again quite a long delay sat on tarmac with little explanation and a very rude attendant when my husband enquired about the delay note to ba customer can accept delay if you explain why and at least offer them a drink while waiting especially when it is early morning and most people are connecting from long overnight flight,positive
club europe flight from london gatwick to seville return outbound on return on outbound flight wa a victim of the french atc strike and british airway did their best to keep u informed about the status of the flight they warned u that the lounge at gatwick wa closed and we used the no lounge instead acceptable but not of similar quality to the ba product we would have wished for the outbound flight had a scheduled departure time of delayed hour due to a combination of french atc strike hour blocked toilet on aircraft minute change of seating configuration of the a that we were allocated resulting in economy passenger being bumped minute no ground crew to push u back from gate remainder pilot and cabin crew did their best but were getting frustrated a were the passenger took off reasonable inflight service outbound return flight no lounge in seville no warning from ba on this reasonable inflight service slow baggage at lgw so no surprise there overall reasonable product and i feel still worth the extra but only just,negative
british airway lounge in t wa very busy a shared with aa and others but good selection of nibble and beer spirit and more important to me it wa clean and the staff were constantly clearing up after guest who had left the boarding wa a very far gate in the satelite area of t and at around the same time we boarding to vancouver a wa boarding to la vega so the area wa very congested the announcement of boarding were barely audible the outward bound flight wa uneventful great and a smooth a trip a i ve ever had inbound wa similar with just the annoyance of waiting for a stand at lhr for minute which spoilt a little the ending the crew both way were superb and professional the business cabin is pretty basic compared to the middle east carrier but you can get some good sleep food wa very good lounge in vancouver wa very nice and staff bright and cheery all in all great flight,positive

los angeles to rome via london with british airway our flight from lax to rome wa on time and generally good we upgraded from economy to premium economy at the airport for each we had tried to upgrade ahead of time with our frequent flyer point but could not because we booked through costco costco said we needed to go thru ba and ba said we had to go thru costco boarding wa not well organized our flight from london wa delayed and we had a difficult time finding out where to go a the airport departure board did not list a gate and departure time kept changing one ba associate told u it would probably leave from gate which proved to be incorrect information we finally asked an attendant at a random gate who looked it up on her ipad we had to sprint back to gate with minute until departure when we arrived at that gate we were told we would be bussed to our gate we waited another minute for bus seat were fairly comfortable food wa just okay the small steak served wa over cooked and a hard a rock we arrived in rome almost hour late coming home we traveled economy a we decided the charge to upgrade on the way there wa not a good value our flight from rome to london wa late in arriving which made u almost an hour late taking off from rome boarding wa chaotic and you couldn t understand the announcement being made about who wa to board and when other people were turned back rather rudely by ba staff everyone seemed confused snack on board wa small but tasty we had to be express serviced through security in london in order to catch our connecting flight no time to catch a snack or use the toilet boarding wa in process when we arrived at the gate then we sat on the tarmac for an hour before we could take off seat were very narrow and close together to the point that when the person in front of you reclined their seat the back of the seat wa very close to your face you had to go horizontal in order to get in and out of the seat to use the rest room arm rest between seat and at the end of the row did not lift up entirely so you had to slide over the arm rest food wa pretty good on board entertainment wa good service wa slow forcing you to sit for an extended length of time with a tray squeezed in front of you our luggage is on an extended vacation a it did not make it to our flight in london we arrived minute late to lax i also take exception to the luggage charge per leg of the trip for our nd bag st bag is no charge but round trip charge for the nd bag is very steep,positive

london heathrow to newark return having just returned from my holiday flying with british airway in their world traveller plus class i thought i would post my review the week before we flew we paid the per person to select our seat so i had the comfort of knowing we would be sat together we flew out of t at lhr one what i think is one of ba s new to newark at am and plane interior looked new and clean we took our seat j and k which were right next to the toilet on our seat we found a small pillow blanket headphone and an amenity kit i had plenty of leg room ok i am and my partner had the entertainment box impacting his leg room but he seemed to be ok with it he is although our seat were next to the toilet we didn t get disturbed movement or smell once the curtain wa pulled between u and world traveller you wouldn t have known we were by the bathroom we were offered a glass of something fizzy water and juice were also available hot towel were handed out menu were handed out and main course wa a choice of beef or chicken with a pasta salad to start and a strawberry cheesecake for dessert with cheese and biscuit the food wa ok it wa hot and tasted good the food service wa quick and prior to the food served drink were handed out including a drink for the meal however during food service another drink wa also offered so three small bottle of wine for the flight and i wa well on my way to relaxing and starting my holiday a we didn t have anyone behind u we could recline our seat without worrying about disturbing anyone a there wa a wall behind u we couldn t recline a far back a others but it wa comfortable enough luckily for both of u the people in front of u didn t really recline theirs too far the seat wa really comfortable and even with my generous back side i felt i had plenty of room although i had loaded up my tablet with film and book i didn t use it at all neither did i use the vast choice of ife i used to hour flight time to have some me time my partner found plenty of choice and enough to watch during the flight after food the mood lighting wa switched on and stayed that way until we were an hour from landing most people me included took the opportunity to have a bit of shut eye a sandwich and small chocolate bar tea and coffee wa served and after a quick freshen up in my seat the pilot announced we would be landing and that the toilet would only be available for another minute or so i quickly brushed my teeth to freshen up but what wa annoying wa the number of people who decided to have almost a full make over in the toilet spending or more minute in there whilst the queue of people waiting to use the facility grew longer however the toilet were clean the landing wa smooth and we arrived on time i suppose you would say we were minute early but don t the airline have that little trick of appearing to land early on leaving the plane i did have a look at business class and without offending regular business class user i did wonder exactly what you get for your money all the pod looked very tightly packed together,positive
uneventful british airway flight from gatwick to porto take off delayed by minute due to french air traffic control strike and route of flight had to be changed to avoid french airspace cabin crew helpful and cheerful snack and drink provided quite adequate for this short flight seat reasonably comforatable and more legroom than most budget airline now that ba price are competitive with many budget airline this additional leg room becomes important flight arrived a few minute late at opo but some of the lost time wa made up during the flight overall a pleasant flight,positive

we travelled on ba from athens on th of june the flight departed at pm but sat on the tarmac for min due to bad weather at london nonetheless we only got in minute late what went wrong from the very beginning wa the check in process we had showed up early but wa refused check in at club europe the ground attendant at athens wa incredibly rude and abrupt if they had explained it to u nicely we would have been fine with it the result of the two hour before flight check in resulted in chaos and long line given the fact that it wa a a larger than usual plane when we finally lined up it took a good minute and more to check in at club europe because for half that time there wa only one counter open eventually a second counter opened but a young couple jumped the queue by using the excuse that she wa pregnant unheard of policy and she wa perfectly healthy given how fast she rushed up and that wa allowed by the ground atttendants despite the long line up eventually we got to the plane only to find a ridiculous two tier business class system that stretched into the economy section without any separation of any kind seating became problematic a those assigned to the window on each side had smaller space and in fact were no more bigger than the economy class the middle seat were fine a passenger there had the empty middle seat british airway were passing off economy seat a business but though the service wa different you couldn t properly enjoy it we were placed on the last row of business class and these were three seat stretching into the economy class cabin it wa so confusing that the crew tried to serve economy class food to our end to be fair i think other business class passenger had it more unfortunate in their seat assignment furthermore when asked for a blanket i wa refused one on the basis there wa none until i walked into the upper cabin and found that business class passenger there had blanket how is this fair what principle of seat assignment did they use the last few ba trip to europe have been nightmarish from boarding process this one in athens wa chaotic and unsystematic they had allowed everyone to rush forward thus blocking the pre boarding process we were assigned different seat far from each other and not according to our preference in our exec club the online check in keep breaking down and when we tell ba that they tell u to call in laugh out hysterically here in fact the more frequent you are a flyer but not high profile the worse treatment you get i also get a sense that communication between the crew is poor given that different service were offered later on the cabin director told me she could find a blanket for me but we were already min from landing i cannot blame the crew they work with what they get if we knew we were going to be treated no better than economy we would have booked economy,negative

i think that british airway customer service must hold the accolade a the worst going but that is their only achievement having booked our flight from alicante to gatwick i immediately selected and paid for seat in row at a cost of each when i came to check in online hour before the flight i found that we had been moved to row the very back of the plane when i selected change your seat row wa not even displayed i am year old with back problem that make it quite difficult to struggle to the back of the plane for this reason i am always more than happy to pay for seat near to the front and have never experienced any problem with other airline i did not and have not received any notification from ba to tell me they had changed the seating nor have i received my money back while waiting to board the plane i received a text message survey on my ba experience so far i participated and gave a summary of the situation i also agreed that they could contact me but still nobody did when i got home i gave ba one day to contact me but when they did not i submitted a complaint through their website after some day i got a reply saying would you like to claim a refund for your prepaid seating charge we ll be more than happy to see if you re eligible if you complete the following form within day of your flight i cannot think of another time where a supplier ha taken my money failed to deliver and not informed me and automatically refunded my money but with ba you have to claim a refund and then wait while they check your eligibility my family take many flight each year including long haul to asia needless to say that none of these will ever be on british airway,positive

for those who have alluded to there being have and have nots on ba flight in term of customer service i can assure them this is not the case i am a gold executive club member and can confirm that i have invariably been treated with equal level of contempt a a customer at all level of their executive and club and most cabin my last experience wa with my wife flying from london gatwick to faro on the may checked in at the first counter for our economy flight to be told by the apparently gleeful ba employee that the plane wa rammed so we knew we would be in for an uncomfortable flight the lounge that are available whilst the ba lounge are renovated were packed and filthy the ba lounge greeter offered no apology when we couldn t access the clubroom that were full the flight wa late and chaotic a group of loud boisterous men were virtually running the economy cabin roaming the cabin whilst the seatbelt sign were on and raiding the galley to return with clutch of mini wine and spirit this resulted in my wife being told they had run out of gin and tonic it turned out to be a lie when the purser emerged from club to serve one of the other passenger with a g t on a tray returned home day later and complained received a jumbled response cancelled all non essential flight with them in the future including high yield club world flight and will only use them when forced they didn t seem to care so good luck to them,negative

la vega to london heathrow return and we did not have a good experience with british airway both flight were incredibly hot and stuffy unlike anything i ve ever experienced flying on any other airline i tend to run cold and usually need a sweater on plane but i wa uncomfortably hot the whole time my husband and some of the other passenger sitting near me also commented on how stuffy it wa the staff on our return flight were rude to passenger and nice only to a select few i definitely got the impression that you are either a have or a have not with this airline and if you re a have not then don t even bother expecting any courtesy from the staff the people sitting next to me had a complaint and it took hour for a staff member to address them on our return flight we asked about paying to upgrade our seat but were told it wa a full flight and we wouldn t be able to because some passenger were receiving complimentary upgrade and others were being downgraded i thought it wa odd that they would be giving free upgrade if it meant downgrading passenger who had paid for better seat but what wa even more odd wa that some passenger didn t know they d been downgraded until they got on the plane a group of passenger got on the plane and went to their seat only to find that they weren t the economy plus seat they d paid for and reserved they were regular coach seat they had all the paperwork showing that they d paid for economy plus so this wasn t an error on their part they were told it wa a full flight and they could get off the plane if they wanted a couple of passenger in this group were elderly and had paid for economy plus because an elderly lady in the group had a medical condition with her blood circulation so she needed the extra leg room this poor old lady had to spend at least half the hour flight standing in the aisle the boarding process in la vega wa smooth but boarding at heathrow wa a joke the staff only made one announcement and must not have had their speaker turned on because it wa barely audible a a result no one knew where they were supposed to go and people were standing in the wrong line and basically all over the place it made boarding take forever the entertainment selection wa sub par for such a long flight a few decent movie but not much else i thought the food wa decent and they served plenty of food and drink for the flight,negative
my wife and i flew to dublin from london heathrow in business class on a avios upgrade with british airway we used the lounge in terminal which had a good selection of food and drink we were delayed leaving for just over an hour for technical reason salmon salad and a couple of drink on the hour flight good value with an almost free upgrade would not pay the normal price for such a short trip,positive
very good flight back to london from barbados bridgetown barbados is a small airport but the ground staff are very friendly and efficient and the exec lounge is good with reasonable snack given the time of day mid late afternoon and a decent selection of drink available aircraft wa clean and it looked a if the club world cabin had recently received some tlc entertainment system wa excellent with a good choice of movie and very clear screen no doubt part of the overall attention the cabin seemed to have been given bar service wa good and the food wa tasty good portion size the cheesecake for dessert wa almost too much being a night flight the crew got the bar and food service completed early in the flight allowing passenger to get some sleep before the light came back up for breakfast breakfast wa good cabin crew were excellent friendly and efficient cockpit crew were clear and concise with their comms at the start and end of the trip previous flight i have taken from lgw have shown a noticable difference in the cabin interior compared to flight form lhr so it wa good to see the lgw fleet getting some needed enhancement,positive
london heathrow to miami with british airway awful experience changed our flight from a morning flight to an evening flight on the way out and refused to refund the difference a we were put on a cheaper flight then cancelled our return flight without informing u so had to spend an hour of our final evening on holiday speaking to an advisor the plane on the way out wa very old many tv s broken and very uncomfortable staff are extremely unhelpful and will never use ba ever again,negative
every flight we took in british airway for our two vacation flight had huge problem always delayed from ny a hour delay in line computer glitch they were handwriting boarding pass another leg check in wa botched their issue and we had to stand with the very rude employee who botched it all up and kept trying to call his manager who never picked up for minute which held up a very long line of check in we are here at heathrow tired and ready for our way home already a hour delay no explanation just read that british airway had to turn a plane around this morning due to engine issue,negative
after my positive post of the outbound journey the return from philadelphia to london heathrow reminded me how inconsistent british airway ha become before boarding wa told just f passenger but actually the cabin wa full presumably upgrade though supposedly no other cabin overbooked this really doe downgrade the experience for fare paying passenger good greeting though csd never did speak to passenger a far a i could see sleeper suit and amenity pack on seat before we boarded rather than the usual personal offer to each passenger pre departure warm champagne served and that wa the last drink i wa offered other than a bottle of water until breakfast did not eat a had been told that since this is a sleeper service i should eat on the ground very little crew presence in the cabin during the night and i wa awake for a good part of it very poor value for money on this occasion,positive
on the th may i reviewed british airway flight from bangkok to london which wa not great with a score given after changing the return flight we opted to travel a to singapore very pleased to say that overall the experience wa excellent the premium economy product on this aircraft is fantastic seat pitch entertainment unit overall comfort wa good the food wa ok but i think attention to detail is lacking to polish off this product st meal you receive ha metal cutlery yet the second meal is plastic only a minor negative the crew were ok did their job and that wa it love the a layout with premium economy on the upperdeck,positive
i would have been very disappointed indeed if i had paid a full fare for my business class ticket the food wa just appalling i could hardly get two mouthful our of my starter and the main course beef wa hard tasteless and very small compared to business class meal in say cathay pacific or qatar airway portion on both starter and main were around less incredibly british airway serve such mean meal in business class on a transatlantic route where they make most of their money i wa hungry after the meal so later on decided to raid the larder but they only had sweet which i generally avoid the menu state there would be yoghurt and other stuff there they were not available the fa were embarrassed and got me some cheese plus were excellent service good selection of ife and comfortable enough seat a larger pillow would do although i hate having to climb over someone to get out of my seat british airway revamped iberia after they merged but now iberia ha a much better business class product,positive
flew british airway from singapore to sydney unfortunately it wa the poorest seating arrangement we have experienced in six different airline business class flight we were face to face with a stranger and though the seat went flat for sleeping they were too narrow in addition the flight attendant seemed to be disinterested the ba business class lounge in singapore wa excellent,negative
everything about this british airway flight from london gatwick to paphos wa excellent checked in at the airport the day before which took minute on the day through fast track security in minute and on to the lounge having read other review we must have struck lucky we sat in the library which wa an oasis of calm the service at the bar wa prompt and the food good just a good a the old ba lounge if not better boarding wa quick and efficient took off a few minute late crew friendly and efficient drink service good and food both choice tasty landed on time and through passport and baggage within minute a great start to our holiday,positive
very decent flight in business from barcelona to heathrow with british airway extremely helpful and pleasant crew served a decent breakfast on this two hour hop which arrived terminal no transfer service for first class passenger to terminal where the security screening wa insanely chaotic due to delay at security and the fact that all a flight leave from the b c pier i had minute in the lounge first class a service wa fine but underwhelming compared to other carrier nice crew but just decent food and service and no wi fi not worth the money at all,positive
st lucia to gatwick with british airway we checked in on line and dropped the luggage off and were quickly through security the lounge wa small but quite comfortable with a nice lady serving drink at the bar i asked her if she could make me a rum punch and despite causing a small queue she happily made me an excellent cocktail boarding wa well organised and the flight departed on time on board we were extremely well looked staff were very professional and were able to find the time to chat and make my wife and i feel very comfortable the wine choice were explained very well with the offer of tasting each bottle dinner wa plentiful if not that exciting but the numerous glass of wine helped to make it wa an enjoyable experience we landed on time and after a brief scare from the pilot who said that due to the french air traffic controller strike there may be a delay in parking the plane we soon disembarked and were in the luggage hall within around minute the luggage arrived quickly and we were soon on our way home overall a very good flight thanks in main to the excellent cabin crew,positive
we arrived at gatwick just after to catch the flight to st lucia check in wa fine and although security wa tight we were airside just after before having breakfast we checked the flight information screen which indicated that the departure gate would be available at after tea and toast we checked at and the board indicated that the departure information would now be available obviously this wa the first time that alarm bell start ringing a it wa plain to see that we were going to be delayed the on screen information then changed again to say that the departure detail would be available at at this point i did venture down to the british airway information desk but a there wa a queue of around fifteen people i gave up and sat down again at the screen info finally said that we had a new departure time of during all of this time i should add that at no time wa any information other than the screen made available to passenger regarding the flight or detail of refreshment etc despite numerous announcement from easyjet and other airline ba wa conspicuous by it silence we were eventually notified of the gate number and for the first time we were told a we entered the departure area the reason for the delay apparently there had been a problem with the cargo door and they had decided it needed to be replaced despite the rather cramped departure area everyone seemed ready to board until we were told that the repair were not complete and there would be a further delay and if some passenger wanted to stretch their leg they could leave their boarding pass with the ground staff and leave the departure area eventually we boarded just after when everyone wa settled in their seat the pilot apologised again and said the repair still hadn t been completed and a further delay wa likely we eventually departed just after after a delay of over five and a half hour now i know stuff happens but let s not forget that we were departing from one of ba s home airport and why they couldn t have a second plane available quicker than five and a half hour is anybody s guess various people writing on online forum have previously spoken about the holiday route from gatwick being dumbed down by ba in favour of the traditional business route flying out of heathrow i have no idea whether this is true or not but i would ask one question if this flight had been a morning flight from heathrow to jfk would ba have found a solution quicker once in the air the flight wa fine nothing special but nothing bad and would have been acceptable without the delay,negative
a mediocre service on this airline flying from london heathrow to stuttgart which wa to be expected given my prior flight with them check in process wa fine at heathrow after security i went to the first class lounge on the south side of heathrow terminal the lounge had no air conditioning and so wa very hot a it wa a fairly warm day outside this made it quite uncomfortable the hot food selection wa poor everything wa very liquid based and looked unappetizing there were a few bland sandwich available a well while the lounge itself is in a beautiful large room it is really let down by the lack of good food and service boarding process wa seamless at the gate the plane had been recently renovated but the seat were highly uncomfortable there is very little legroom available and if you re taller than you re knee will likely be touching the seat in front of you food offering wa very limited with only a small bag of chip on offer and one drink flight attendant were courteous but didn t really go beyond the minimum no inflight entertainment or wifi whatsoever wa available which is really a disappointment given that so many other airline are now installing this overall the trip wa fine but the onboard and lounge experience could be improved,positive
man to lhr with personable crew who did the breakfast service efficiently concorde room fine and not too crowded on this saturday morning smooth boarding with friendly reception and guide to seat experienced crew who interacted with passenger full cabin but service a expected though initial drink perhaps a little slow coming food fine a wa selection of wine despite late departure arrived on time a very relaxed and enjoyable journey good service also very good fare from their sale last month,positive
london to bucharest with british airway the flight wa slightly delayed i wasn t impressed with the boarding process it wa a full flight and most of the passenger carried more than one piece of cabin luggage it took some time for passenger to find space to store the luggage and this slowed down the process this also had an impact on the speed of getting off the plane when we arrived in bucharest they should have been stricter with the cabin luggage allowance a it wa a more than hour flight they served a hot meal the food wa not that good but enough to survive the hour plus flight,negative
shambolic check in at new york jfk following the introduction of new computer system by british airway the long queue subsequently caused delay in flight to uk lot of manager milling around not doing anything useful no attempt wa made to keep passenger informed of the reason for the delay the flight itself to london heathrow wa fine ba s business class doe what you would expect it to do but there are few surprise or particular high point not a patch on the service by cathy pacific,negative

london gatwick to lima with british airway this is a recently introduced non stop route offer a reasonable price for club class until you add the seat reservation charge which added a further to each seat each way to the overall charge we sat on the tarmac for hour at gatwick while we waited for someone senior to sign off the repair fault on the return journey the flight took off hour late no explanation and then when we arrived at gatwick we stood for hour for our luggage to appear while other flight around u arriving later collected theirs there wa little advantage if any to using ba on this route and we could have gone the existing route through madrid with little more hassle the flight wa comfortable the staff pleasant and the food mediocre,positive

after a hiatus of almost year the heathrow to inverness route wa reinstated in may for the last few year travelling to inverness from geneva we have been using easyjet via gatwick so i thought it would be interesting to see how ba compare to it budget rival when travelling to the north of scotland overall i would say not particularly favourably bag drop i checked in online so just had to go through bag drop however with only one agent on the desk dedicated to economy passenger versus agent for business passenger ba bag drop in geneva wa a slow and painful experience and slower than i have recently experienced with easyjet in geneva boarding in geneva wa fairly smooth no better or worse than easyjet in flight staff were friendly and efficient however the complimentary breakfast of a ham and cheese croissant could best be described a awful a croissant in name only given the price premium my overall opinion is that ba are not providing sufficiently better service in comparison to easyjet considering the price premium between the two airline,positive
flew with british airway on a hour flight from dubai to london in economy with the tiniest tv screen i have seen in the last year it wa so small you had to squint most of the time to make out what wa going on and the resolution wa terrible and irritated the eye the screen had little cross in it this must have been an ancient plane the movie selection wa old given that i watched the same movie month earlier nothing that is currently in the cinema we only had one meal and when we asked for additional food there were only snack in form of chocolate bar and biscuit we were also not allowed to have any sparkling wine which is ridiculous a they have it on tap in business class the staff seemed irritated most of the time especially the lady in business class who welcomed u very disappointing experience,negative
going against the grain somewhat i have to say that i truly prefer flying with british airway over emirate on the london heathrow dubai route having tried both airline several time i am definitely going to side with ba on this one firstly ba offer some really competitive price on this route if you happen to have a few avios tucked away then this flight can be a real steal secondly out of lhr ba really doe have the best terminal okay so terminal for emirate isn t the worst terminal in the world but i much prefer terminal spacious light and with good dining option a for the aircraft well it s a choice between choosing the passenger pleaser that is the a or the retro classic that is the b i ll happily fly in either although even after the refit the is still showing it s age a an economy passenger i have found the product on british airway to be perfectly reasonable the seat pitch is average seat comfort is average ife screen size again is average you get a choice of the latest blockbuster and a few other option with emirate you have a huge ife thousand of film to choose from and slightly better seat width and pitch however i ve also wondered what the appeal is of choosing from thousand of film that i have no interest in watching i d rather just take my ipad preloaded with film i actually want to watch the lack of wifi isn t a huge concern for me hopefully the gogo ku product ba is installing from will be more robust now for the catering a an economy passenger i m not expecting much but on the last few flight with ba i have been pleasantly surprised the food ha not only been edible but also really quite tasty where ba fall down is on presentation which is quite frankly awful it s also the little extra that i notice a pre dinner drink service coffee and tea offered throughout the cabin real cheese and cracker to finish off the meal a opposed to soft cheese i m not year old with ba you also get a more substantial snack prior to landing it s just a little tuck box but it is far more generous than the emirate economy offering i ve found the crew to be hit and miss in fairness i ve found that treating crew in the same friendly and warm manner a you expect to be treated normally brings out the best in them the recent newspaper deal with the murdoch empire is a nice touch along with the daily hate and i newspaper to choose from you also get the time the sun and financial time a complimentary option arrival for ba at dxb is a bit of a nightmare terminal immigration is something else and the journey from runway to stand can be epic however the new concourse d for departure is really nice not too blingy overall a pleasant flight i would happily fly with ba again,positive
i wa very impressed with the world traveller plus experience on british airway from london heathrow to san francisco obviously this is a very new aircraft for ba but the seat and service experience really were very good and so much more pleasant than an economy flight i had a window seat so benefited from the extra space afforded by the location of the storage cabinet underneath the window the seat wa very comfortable situated on the upper deck in the a which is a very quiet plane to travel in and i enjoyed a couple of movie on the large screen with great sound via the supplied noise cancelling headset the food wa pretty good and alcohol freely served the only negative experience wa being turned back from priority boarding at lhr even though i have ruby status with ba the ground agent wa a little condescending in the way he handled it to be honest and of course i felt embarrassed in front of the other passenger but the signage by the priority boarding lane clearly indicated that ruby traveler had the benefit of priority boarding i wa a year qualifying gold card holder on british midland but ba ha chosen to not recognise all the frequent traveler who achieved this status over a decade of loyalty to the airline they bought claiming they had no lifetime member status in executive club however i believe this is now something they do in fact offer this is why i have reduced my score to otherwise full mark,positive
flew british airway from gatwick to punta cana where to begin i ll start with the check in at gatwick having checked in online i wa expecting a relatively simple baggage drop off how wrong could i be desk servicing every flight we arrived at the airport hour before the scheduled departure time and spent of these in the baggage drop off queue due to the slow service many passenger were getting called forward to jump the queue so a to not miss the flight the staff on the desk looked thoroughly miserable and spent more time talking to each other than dealing with the customer security check were surpsingly efficient but due to the time taken to drop off the bag we had no time to visit any shop and had to go straight to the gate despite having arrived hour early onboard the aircraft thing improved a little the food wa good and the crew very attentive however the ife is very dated on the gatwick based s my screen kept jumping every second and stopped functioning completely an hour into the flight the crew tried to reset the system but when it reset i no longer had the option to choose what to watch and could only watch the old style video loop this wouldn t have been a problem for me if not for the fact that i paid an extra on top of the ticket price to choose a seat overall a negative experience but i can t fault the cabin crew or the inflight service,negative
this wa a flight from gatwick to bermuda on a with british airway the aircraft wa clean and reasonably comfortable and the cabin crew were friendly and attentive i am ft tall and normally have problem with the leg room offered in economy aer lingus i m talking about you but there wa ample leg room indeed on walking through premium economy and club world on exiting the aircraft i didn t notice a big difference in leg room i haven t flown ba for quite some year and had vague memory of the inflight meal being particularly shoddy not this time though my meal wa reasonably nice chicken korma and my fianc e had no complaint either with her pasta dish the crew were round regularly with complementary soft drink a well a snack and glass of water or pure orange the ife had a good selection though one gripe is the positioning of the control there is a small controller built in to the top of the arm rest this controller control the ife a well a your reading light and call button more than once i accidentally pressed the light and the call button with my elbow while shifting position a small gripe but it wa quite annoying another gripe is the advert you have to sit through when starting to watch a new selection i wa on continental and virgin a couple of year ago and don t believe i had to sit through advert before watching a movie or tv programme overall aside from the small ife issue a thoroughly pleasant flight,positive
london to calgary it s hard to know quite what make a more comfortable less dry air quieter or bigger window but this service wa good the ife wa excellent and a cut above the older system on some ba flight very nice crew and good food and drink my only complaint is that lunch wa served at pm london time followed by tea at about midnight why not tea after take off and dinner at say,positive
warsaw to heathrow and the check in is only open hour before and i wanted to shop and eat british airway is the only one that i could see that had such a late check in don t bother with business class you won t gain much time on this flight making the lounge a waste of time they need an earlier check in wish i d never upgraded,positive
milan malpensa to london heathrow with british airway hr standing in queue to check in due to new system installed last month running slow so why no extra staff to cope with this plane then cancelled min after time due to technical issue no system in place to cope with the size of what then needed to be done everyone had to re claim baggage exit via passport control and queue at service desk to re book unbelievably desk staffed by only one person people with onward connection were being given priority so their journey could be re planned but each of these took to min to process with a line of people waiting behind thus by the time one person had been served another had been prioritised to front of queue meaning that the queue wa effectively not moving over hour later a third of the queue wa still standing in line waiting to be processed it wa only the self discipline of those in the queue that prevented this descending into total chaos why not two terminal so the onward traveller could be dealt with separately from those with simple need why no seating and no queue management system pathetic response to what must be a an occasional problem then had to re present to re check in again via their slow new system and go again through security mercifully top class and passport control for evening flight those who d queued longest stayed in hotel to travel next day no meal voucher offered no compensation detail offered tho given when asked for,negative
my first long haul with british airway for year bought because it wa a good price for a direct bangkok london heathrow and seating not boarding wa efficient and departure on time meal were typically british notably using british brand or dish and acceptable ife and moving map were a touch old fashioned and clunky small screen and limited selection but still just about adequate seat foam wa thin and movement of the passenger behind could often be felt which wa irritating cabin crew on this hour full flight were very hard working would use airline again at the right price,negative
flew ibiza to gatwick with british airway a massive and slow moving queue in ibiza at pm wa not a good start no announcement about a delay but plane took off minute late boarding wa painfully slow a late night flight so no refreshment good excuse to save money but i guess people prefer to sleep flight wa not busy compared to totally full outbound flight a few day before but return ticket wa costly,negative
london to paris cdg in business class british airway ha always been one of my favourite airline however there are just a few point that really bug me the business class check in counter queue wa longer in comparison to other counter e g economy at terminal at security the fast track queue were also longer,positive
every airline which offer business class travel will assign seat when booking the flight the exception is british airway in january i booked a flight for two passenger on ba in business class from san francisco to london and back for travel in may june seat in business class are not assigned until hour before flight time however and here come another ba first if you want to choose your seat before that time you can do so by paying an extra fee i ended up shelling out for the privilege of selecting two seat for the return flight this on top of the steep fare charged for travel in business class i don t begrudge the airline for their extra profit when the price of fuel take a massive drop but when an airline then also engages in tactic a described in order to further maximize profitability i rebel,positive

my partner and i were flying from london heathrow to bombay in march and were due to catch an onward flight to goa unfortunately someone fell seriously ill on the flight and our plane wa redirected to istanbul to allow for them to be taken to a hospital the redirection meant that we arrived in bombay hour late and wouldn t make our connecting flight when we touched down in bombay the flight attendant said that ba ground staff would help u with missed flight connection etc and we should speak with them when we disembarked on this advice we sought out uniformed ba ground staff in the luggage hall and asked for advice on what to do they advised u to exit the hall and find an airport based travel agent and purchase new flight to goa when we voiced our concern about not being reimbursed they reassured u saying that ba would definitely cover it and went on to say that we should wait day before making a claim through the website armed with this advice from ba staff we went ahead and purchased new ticket big mistake since returning home we have duly followed instruction and tried to claim for reimbursement here is the reply we received from ba customer relation we ve received a reply from mumbai who ve investigated your case the agent you spoke to can t specifically remember speaking to you personally he did mention he d advised customer with separate ticket to make their own arrangement he also mentioned ba wasn t responsible for any onward travel cost this is an outright lie i can only conclude that the ba staff member we spoke with in bombay wa either fobbing u off or wa improperly instructed in what to say to customer either way british airway should be held responsible for the advice their staff give poor service at the time and poor customer service in the follow up,negative
my husband and i flew to st lucia from london gatwick on th may this wa the first time i ve flown with british airway and it will also be the last are british airway training their staff to be a rude and obnoxious a possible this is certainly how it seems with the awful cabin service we experienced our food wa literally thrown at u with not a hint of a smile the gentleman sitting next to me asked the stewardess very politely if he could have a drink to which she replied if you want another drink you ll have to go up to the back of the aircraft and get it yourself a i have far too much to do to be running back and forward with drink for you strange a i thought they were there to help passenger we thought we were just unlucky with this journey but sadly not a the return journey wa pretty much the same miserable unhelpful and downright rude cabin crew very disappointed a i thought british airway would have a bit more class than this,negative

barbados to gatwick on ba flight left on time and arrived at gatwick slightly ahead of schedule a many have commented the british airway configuration in club world is odd and i can only assume they chose this to get extra seat in compared with a more traditional layout a the flight wa overnight my wife and i decided to chose the two centre rear facing seat which offered least disturbance the downside of this is you can get missed and in my case the cabin crew passed me at the meal service and i had to gesture to get them back food and drink service wa however otherwise fine breakfast included a bacon roll which wa nice flatbed reasonable comfortable and we got a few hour sleep,positive

there are many negative review on this site it almost embarrassing to admit to flying ba i am adding another one i have flown ba on of for year i guess that make me qualified to write a review my main gripe is the total lack of value for money the erosion of quality and service and the sky rocketing price this flight from heathrow to barcelona and the return accentuates the lack of value barcelona flight operates out of terminal at lhr quite why ba use this ageing and outdated terminal is a mystery you walk mile and if you are unfamiliar with this point a we were you end up running a panicked race to the gate it worse on arrival immigration and passport control wa a zoo the t business lounge is mediocre plastic table and chair the most awful selection of dried out bacon bap and dried out omelette stuffed into baguette the seating area overlooking the airport wa cluttered with newspaper there wa plenty of booze flight left on time the meal inflight i could not be bothered with fa all fine on the return the shared lounge wa surprisingly good more comfortable than t at lhr ageing plane mediocre afternoon tea frumpy fa who forgot to hand out our fast track ticket to help speed up through immigration we got held up for half an hour on both flight we had to endure the silly club europe seat basically two seat with the middle seat closed down into a table cramped leg room definitely no value here i only fly ba when i have to it really need a clean out of the management and a new team with some vision on how to make british airway a world leader which right now they fail miserably to achieve in all their cabin,positive

british airway have seriously gone downhill there is absolutely no difference between them and low cost airline i would actually prefer easyjet and ryanair a at least they are transparent this journey from lyon to london heathrow wa chaotic and stressful thanks to ba charging to check in luggage one way every passenger take cabin baggage this mean everyone flock to queue up like cattle well before any announcement are even made the boarding process made more unpleasant by them calling different group out i have honestly never seen anything like it once on board they had to stow a lot of luggage in the hold a it couldn t fit passenger were arguing with one another separate fight were witnessed and staff were being very aggressive shoving bag and coat in every nook and cranny and telling people to move the meal service is a joke a pathetic barely edible sandwich a always with ba flight to and from lhr this flight wa late we ended up flying round and round over london for min the worst thing is ba s new policy of charging to select a seat even at online check in opening hour before this mean they assign you any rubbish seat and you have to pay just to change it to any normal seat and even more if extra legroom ba s new policy seems to be to nickel and dime customer at every possible step of the way and charge more than other airline in the process a shame they have turned this airline into something worse than low cost i will definitely be avoiding them wherever possible,negative

berlin to philadelphia via london heathrow i ve traveled with british airway many time and always thought it wa a decent airline and preferred it for my trip back to philadelphia over some of the other airline however this last trip ha changed my mind and i will no longer fly with ba we were given misprinted ticket for our connecting flight in lhr which led to u missing our flight despite showing our ticket to several ba employee we rushed to the gate printed on our ticket where the woman at the counter informed u our flight wa departing from a the terminal where we had just come from we had to run with all our carry on luggage and winter clothing the distance the train normally take you upon reaching a we saw it s actually sub divided in section a a b c etc this caused even more confusion at first it took u the wrong way of course when we finally found the correct gate the flight wa already gone the ba employee at the gate apologized and told u to require to be rebooked because the problem wa the fault of his colleague at the customer service counter they also admitted the mistake and pointed it out to a colleague who also agreed they had never seen this kind of error before another woman in line behind u had the same issue and missed the same flight for the same reason the customer service woman did her best for u and gave u new ticket but for a much later flight and advised u write you in order to follow it up when we did try to follow it up i wa sent a response that wa clearly cut and pasted with error and typo and did not address the issue of my complaint i tried to call a few time to speak to an agent in person but ended up waiting for close to an hour and having to pay several euro customer service wa terrible and i can t imagine how it would have been if there wa a more serious issue aside from this the flight were cramped and the entertainment system wa outdated small screen with a poor selection and you have to hit your finger hard against the screen to get it to work not to mention the beginning of our flight way back until after the food wa served the system wa out of order the last complaint is about the airline food a a vegetarian normally i like ba food but this time it wa a joke my special meal consisted of considerably less food than my boyfriend who had the regular meal the pasta wa one of the worst i ve had on flight and when breakfast came around i got a recycled fruit cup from my dinner while everyone else received a full box of food it wa so bad it wa comical,negative
completely unimpressed with british airway they lost my luggage on a flight from dublin to london when i informed them they did not apologise but assured me i would have my bag by that afternoon i wa lucky my air bnb provided me with a towel and toiletry i had not heard from them by pm and wa told to wait until they contacted me i then got a message at pm at night to say they had found my bag and the courier wa picking it up at pm and then it would be delivered so i specifically stayed home that night and finally decided at midnight they were not going to deliver it so went to sleep i woke up and called british airway at am to ask when it wa going to arrive and where wa it a i got a message saying it wa being picked up at pm the night before so had stayed home they said to call the courier company i then called the courier company and they said that it wa a mistake and they would never deliver a bag that late at night they then said the driver had a late night so wouldn t arrive until lunch time that day so i went out for the morning and returned to my apartment at lunch i then received a message at lunch time that said they would actually not arrive until sometime between and pm that afternoon i called to see if i could get a more specific time or they could tell me when they were on the way they said no and that i would have to wait at my apartment for two hour and to call at pm if my bag had not arrived this wa ridiculous i am so lucky my air bnb host supplied me with towel and a toothbrush and that i had money to go out and buy clothes for the day so unimpressed with british airway and their disorganisation with my bag i understand bag are lost but to be told that it wa coming at three different time and also the fact that british airway decided it had nothing to do with them anymore and to contact the courier company wa a joke they were the one who lost the bag in the first place on a minute flight with no transfer,negative
i flew to lhr t on british airway with a connecting flight on avianca to bogota from terminal the staff at paris airport refused to check in my piece of luggage on the continuing avianca flight because i had not booked that ticket with ba i had bought separate ticket i realized that this would result in having to collect my luggage at t go through passport control then go to terminal by underground a there wa a problem with heathrow express when i pointed out to the ba staff the impact this would have they said it wa my fault for booking separate ticket and avianca are not part of oneworld like ba but in star alliance,negative

these day i dread flying british airway either long haul or short haul this flight in business class from london heathrow to nice wa a pleasant surprise the gallery lounge at t is usually rammed and dirty but a our flight wa am it wasn t too bad although a usual the food offering very poor compared to other airline boarding a mess surely if you have paid to fly business class you should be able to board before gold silver member who then wander down to economy great fa nice hot or cold breakfast choice and drink offering on the hr min flight luggage off promptly return again good stacked over kent for min luggage took minute to get to belt priority bag all over the place would use again for a short hop but try and avoid business long haul,positive
london gatwick to amsterdam i wa bumped off this british airway flight a a result of a change of plane to an a i gather the process wa not well handled and it appeared that some staff and or standby passenger were given priority although others also missed out i understand the main issue were lack of clarity at the airport a to what the issue wa last minute confirmation of offloading which left u short of time to take another flight a poor process for transferring airport i had to bus from gatwick to heathrow and poor follow up when i queried matter afterwards ba refused to state whether staff or standby passenger had been prioritised repeatedly citing privacy i checked with a friend who s a uk privacy legal specialist and this applies to individual but not to category such a staff or standby so it appears to be a refusal by ba to respond i also raised the transfer with ba a this involved further queueing to turn a voucher into a ticket which meant i missed a transfer bus better to issue a ticket or a voucher that can be used on any service that day with ba to arrange it so with the bus company on the positive side i wa compensated per the rule and did make a ba flight later that day which wa ok nonetheless this could have been handled much more smoothly and i m afraid british airway customer service on the ground and in follow up let them down,positive

accra to london heathrow sadly british airway ha gone downhill to start the plane wa dirty excessive hand luggage allowance meant delay to boarding the food wa awful leg room wa non existent i m only subzero temperature during the flight and an inadequate ratio of toilet to passenger left me very uncomfortable the positive were that staff were friendly and courteous under difficult circumstance and they didn t bother forcing u to endure the safety walk through for a hour direct flight at just over this wa the cheapest i could find provided you eat before you fly restrict your water intake wrap up very warm and take your own tablet ereader then it will be fine but it s more a no frill airline service and i d rather fly with easyjet any day,negative
london heathrow to miami return with british airway delay outbound and back with poor communication of both told of a delay which wa extended once we reached the gate and on the return journey and then again once on the plane service on the return journey seemed like steward were going through the motion rather than worried about the level of service i doe seem that the british airway flight to miami and back to london heathrow have very poor punctuality when alternative airline don t have the same issue inflight entertainment on inbound flight not fully working after a reeboot which wa done because some passenger had no service for the first hour,negative

british airway generally doe a good job in economy with reasonably friendly and efficient service the onboard food and drink are a shadow of what they used to be but fare in real term are much lower these day and this is an acceptable trade off this particular flight from dubai to london wa packed and i certainly wasn t comfortable sitting next to a large guy squished into one side of my seat but the cabin crew were fine and one attendant wa charming it s only when i pay to fly business or first that i get irritated i d put british airway ahead of many rival in economy and behind in premium class where the food is particularly disappointing,positive

london to calgary return with british airway and we fly this route about twice a year and in the past have flown in the s which were rather aged but homely this time we had the experience of the new boeing which wa very nice and new and we found the seat just a comfortable particularily in premium economy what we did not enjoy wa the change in attitude from the staff they seemed so different to the crew we had looking after u on the previous run the emphasis wa on getting thing served a fast a they can and woe betide you if you want extra milk for your cup of coffee the food wa good and we felt safe and efficiently cared for but there wa not the fun around that we used to encounter when wandering around in the small hour of the flight when you could go to the galley and get a coffee or a snack after all this is a long haul flight and i can well understand the rush on a short haul flight the person behind u wa air sick which wa not their fault and the cabin crew dealt with this well our return flight wa better and we enjoyed the glass of fizzy prior to take off which is a nice touch and is something that other airline do in premium economy i think that ba manager should travel with other airline to review it premium economy brand finally i think the breakfast is not very nice and could be improved upon like another passenger we went and had something after landing those breakfast box are horrible,positive

london heathrow nairobi kenya boeing not new but clean departed on time food wa very average and wa served at am a a lunch bland and uninteresting cabin crew very quick and efficient but then ran away for most of the flight so that they could get the service over a quickly a possible an hour before landing they reappeared again with cardboard box with a chicken sandwich a drink and that wa it you sometimes wonder whether british airway check the quality of the offer made by other airline or whether it is just customer loyalty that keep them flying nairobi arrival wa a nightmare a my electronic visa had a page not dowloaded and this resulted in an extra hour and a half with immigration before it wa sorted out,positive
left nairobi more or less on time had to wait for a thunderstorm to pas before take off premium economy seat is better than economy in that there is more leg room flight wa packed and the wa subdivided into first club business premium economy and economy not sure whether all these subdivision are really necessary it would have been better to provide customer with a more modern newer aircraft instead of an older with all these seating alternative that look rather dated food wa average choice between grilled steak and chicken and a vegetable salad starter and dried out cake a a dessert cabin crew efficient but hardly any warmer than the food they seemed to want to get the meal out of the way a quickly a possible it wa a night flight and they disappeared until hour before landing when the dreaded cardboard box appeared pretending to be breakfast a pot of yoghurt and a dreadful dry cereal bar arrived on time and immediately went for a coffee and a snack at the airport which of course should have been served a a breakfast on the flight british airway need to wake up and check what other airline offer on the same flight,negative
vancouver to barcelona via heathrow with british airway i would like to start this review by stating that the only review i ve taken time to write in my life were positive one choosing to ignore negativity this however will sadly be my first negative review and even sadder to say that i m taking time to write this before we ve even completed our round trip with british airway to be more direct i m writing this on our final connector flight to barcelona on february th i purchased a round trip with cancellation flight from vancouver canada to barcelona spain this wa a surprise for fiance for her th birthday a well a our year engagement anniversary naturally we counted down the day in excitement booking ourselves an apartment and scheduling reservation for dinner a well a ticket to a barcelona fc match even setting up scheduling for grandparent on each side for our month old daughter april th day before our trip i receive a email labeled updated travel itinerary when i opened the email our flight no longer included our flight from vancouver to barcelona actually they only had a return flight from barcelona on april th a i had got home late on april th from cuba i couldn t contact anyone until early morning of april th my fiance s birthday convinced it wa just a mistake we thought nothing of it upon calling in the morning we were informed that our flight had been cancelled we tried everything we could to make any flight happen that day but were told there wa only seat remaining and that my fiance could fly out on the th and i follow on the th which a an engaged couple make no sense we decided to look past this and try to seek reimbursement for the apartment fee and other thing that we were now out of money on due to arriving a day late this began a huge run around of my fiance trying to submit their online form separate time only for the screen to read submitting for roughly minute each time never one actually submitting we decide again to overlook this and deal with it at the check in counter at yvr the agent we were speaking to wa a very nice lady who went above and beyond to figure out what happened to our flight the previous day a it left a originally scheduled without u on it she put a note on our file that an agent from jacksonville ba had cancelled our flight for no apparent reason we asked for an upgrade on our seat that wasn t available to u we asked for access to the ba lounge while we waited we were told that wa full even though we walked past an empty lounge on the way to our flight after a very uncomfortable flight to heathrow we spoke to an agent there who again wa helpful in pulling up our file note and sending a email to get the ball rolling for u on the reimbursement process which we still have to wait for a reply before we can go ahead trying to recoup slome of our loss which unfortunately still wouldn t get u the day we missed back she went the extra step to grant u access to the lounge while waiting and moved our seat up a few row that wa a breath of fresh air until we realized that we had been moved to the row right behind the curtain while we snacked on a of a sandwich portion of food we could hear the plated dish on the other side of the curtain and good food people were eating all the while staring at minimum empty seat we are now trying to make joke out of the fact of if we will ever get home,positive
doha to london via bahrain with british airway and a very poor lounge in doha even flying first class on ba there is no reciprocal arrangement to access the excellent qatar airway lounge instead there is a lounge for all other airline on boarding my wife and i were ushered to our seat and to our amazement our individual locker were opened by the flight attendant who promptly disappeared without making an offer to hang our coat or jacket a is standard practice on even business class no hot towel before take off or landing very average menu and a we slept through dinner were keen on breakfast told that due to possible turbulence coffee could not be prepared both our cutlery earlier wrapped by the crew were delivered without spoon to eat the very soggy muesli orange juice tropic a quality we had to ask for marmalade with our toast all the crew displayed little perception of customer need made the more marked by qatar airway business class crew who were absolutely excellent on the earlier sydney to doha flight poor food very poor crew awareness or attention to detail who seemed to be going through the motion slightly aloof way below the gulf major in flight attention however bed wa very good a you would expect amenity kit below the qatar airway business class kit and a joke in comparison to qatar first class kit very agreeable cabin and seat but crew performance at economy class performance would avoid again,positive
london to johannesburg and i decided this time to fly with british airway given they fly there with the a i wa quite looking forward to the experience of flying business class on the upper deck of the a i needn t have bothered following an uneventful few hour in the gallery lounge it wa time to board straight onto the upper deck my business colleague before me passed through the gate without problem however i wa told to wait a moment a there wa an issue with my boarding card just a moment sir oh it look like you ve been approved for an upgrade to first which is on the lower deck no sorry my mistake you re still in business upstairs but i m afraid we ve had to move you from your selected seat the one i d paid the not inconsiderable sum of to reserve in advance by the way but not to worry it s still a window seat except it wasn t it wa seat a a windowless seat next to the toilet the journey itself wa uneventful the food a bit of a disappointment without any flavour my beef main wa dry and rather tasteless the wine wa very good entertainment system not bad though not a patch on the like of emirate the staff friendly and efficient enough and i managed to sleep a few hour i wrote to ba to complain about my change of seat and the unprofessionalism of telling someone they had an upgrade when they hadn t i had to chase up twice for a reply the one i eventually got wa pitiful and a impersonal a could be with a stock answer about the need for them to occasionally change people s seat for operational need the biggest issue for me with ba s club world however is it ridiculous layout whereby people have to step over each other s leg i don t know of any other business class product which ha this and it leaf ba well behind the competition although not my favourite airline ba could do worse than take a note of their partner iberia which ha a staggered layout but offer direct aisle access to all the situation whereby you find yourself starring at stranger until one of you decides to raise the privacy screen is also far from ideal and surely not safe a the cabin crew have to constantly lower it to pas hot food and drink over your neighbour can t help but think that ba have missed a real opportunity to shake thing up with their new fleet of a s whilst some airline have been creative and had on board bar lounge and shower ba ha just packed in a many seat a possible there are abreast in club world upstairs and downstairs which is staggering and an insult when paying premium price i should have known better having flown on one of ba s other new addition to it fleet last year a boeing to toronto which also wa extremely claustrophobic i returned home from south africa upstairs on a boeing from cape town to london the plane might have been older but the experience altogether more pleasant this journey ironically took me up to silver membership i won t be choosing to fly long haul with ba again however unless i have to there are far better alternative out there,positive

this wa my second time flying with british airway and this particular route from vancouver to paris cdg via london heathrow round trip wa overall on time without delay online check in wa easy and got to pick out the seat i wanted picked up the boarding pass at the airport without any problem the food wa above average and the cabin crew were courteous and professional drink were frequently served or could be picked up from the galley independently washroom were clean overall a satisfactory experience however one thing almost all traveller on the yvr lhr route will notice is the age of this aircraft i think it should be replaced soon since this is a very popular route i flew in late march and return beginning of april being low season but the cabin wa still full i think this flight deserves a newer aircraft like the a particularly the back of the seat are very thin and one can feel every scratching movement if the person behind try to retrieve item from the front pocket the in flight entertainment system is also very out dated picture were not clear and colour were rather misleading,positive
london heathrow to paris cdg with british airway nothing special for a short flight but wa happy that it wa on time it is interesting that for short haul flight ba us seating that the business seat are the same a economy except that the central seat is kept empty and on this flight it wa not full so i have similar space with my next seat unoccupied snack wa offered free though not hot together with a drink,positive
hong kong to london with british airway i normally prefer aisle seat for long haul but this flight i chose a window seat because it wa an a flight on the upper deck the upper deck situation mean that i can take advantage of a window side drawer where apart from easy storage i can also put something on top and premium economy offer just enough space to move out if needed ba s premium economy service is good the food is not the same for economy a in the case of some airline and the seat acceptably comfortable ba is generous on alcoholic drink though i do not take advantage of it but the food is not very good all in all the flight wa satisfactory,positive
to our amazement we went to board our flight back to london after our holiday in the west coast of the usa and found we were upgraded from economy to club world it wa especially nice for my fianc e who ha only flown economy previously the service and food were very good and the flat bed seat made the flight much more pleasant the a is a lovely aircraft because it is so quiet and look very smart inside,positive
i decided to treat myself to british airway premium economy from beijing to london which wa not much more expensive than economy i had a bulkhead seat which meant i had plenty of legroom and could stretch out on the flight the cabin looked a bit tired but the staff were friendly and professional and i wa comfortable the food wa quite good but a glass of champagne when we boarded would have been nice the ife wa okay but the screen wa small and it malfunctioned during part of the flight,positive
on our recent holiday to the usa i wa very excited to be flying on the new a for the first time after some food in the excellent terminal we went to board and found we were upgraded to premium economy the aircraft wa smart and fresh inside and we were welcomed with champagne the a is by far the quietest aircraft i have ever flown and the ife wa good with lot of choice the food wa decent and we had friendly and professional service on the plane and at heathrow,positive
london heathrow to athens on ba and returned on ba we decided to take a break from the low cost airline and fly british airway to athens a we had found very cheap flight per person per way and good flying time a someone travelling with u is registered blind we could reserve seat before others on both flight with ease priority boarding wa given a well online check in wa smooth and boarding pass on the outbound were printed off on our flight out to athens we were given a choice of a hot or cold meal a i had something to eat before i passed but this wa great given that some people would have been transiting quickly and wouldn t have time to eat at the terminal the night flight on the way back wa also good a meal one hot option only were offered with free drink and pillow were available flight attendant were professional on both flight both flight landed early one min early if there is anything i could ask ba to improve on is allowing one desk open at athens for all flight of the day for anyone that arrives early and just want to print off boarding pass or offer self service kiosk at other airport outside of london in conclusion british airway are better than easyjet or ryanair and if there is only a little price difference i would recommend travelling with them,positive
riyadh to dusseldorf via heathrow with british airway check in at riyadh wa terrible broken baggage belt and staff explaining to passangers that there is an issue instead of fixing it flight to lhr wa smooth and with good service lhr however wa a disaster priority security took forever and the gate agent wa even worse i have a trolley and handluggage a specified first she started complaining about the trolley surprise it wa within size then she looked at my laptop case which wa cm too large and made me check in the trolley worst of all wa her attitude in this i feel that her customer bashing behavior definitely did not comply with the ba image and expectation from business class passenger i will search other option before choosing ba again,negative
british airway used to be better than this i spent all afternoon in the business lounge waiting for my gatwick flight at pm my boarding card said the gate closed at and when i hadn t heard any announcement by i asked the ba man at reception if there wa a delay i wa very dismayed when he casually said yes about hour min i wa very unhappy they had not told u earlier or asked if we needed help getting home in a more timely manner there wa a time when ba would have tried to reroute it premium passenger but this man told me his duty manager had specifically told him not to do this he told me that if i wanted to switch to an earlier lhr or lcy flight i would have to go back landside and buy a ticket for those flight onboard i had my first experience of ba s new club europe wherein the middle seat is covered by a tray to give the perception of more space without actually giving you a wider seat or more legroom from my experience of ba business class in both long and short haul over the past year it is very sad to see that ba is focussing on making change which make it more money rather than change which benefit the passenger experience my meal wa plonked down in front of me without telling me what it wa and it wasn t at all tasty but a stewardess gave me great customer service by giving me a plastic glass to decant my bloody mary into so that i could hold on to it on approach to lgw that wa a very nice touch i hadn t been offered before on any airline i ve flown with,positive
it is very irritating that british airway pre allocated me a middle seat which i wa not allowed to change when checking in online unless i paid pound at the airport self service check in would not let me change seat either so i had to find a customer service desk to get my preferred window seat a waste of my time and theirs the short flight from london gatwick to amsterdam wa ok flight crew spoke to the cabin a few time which i appreciate but cabin crew clearly wished they were somewhere else my catering choice wa water and crisp hardly full service but at least it wa free,positive

london to larnaca i find travelling with british airway somewhat hit and miss at time having flown extensively over the past few year in both club and economy with them it seems a gamble on how the flight attendant mood are on our flight to larnaca the fa s had a terrific attitude were courteous and the cabin service director wa professional and polite the older type seating is far more comfortable than the new slimline seating adopted but still only just bearable after nearly hr of sitting the s still have an air of spaciousness compared to the a that is used on this route all in all a good flight but compared to some airline that offer a lie flat seat with personal entertainment system on medium haul route ba is falling behind,positive

london to rotterdam returning amsterdam to london city airport is undergoing renovation work which give the pier to the gate the feel of an abandoned warehouse the gate lounge is a little more than a portakabin this trip felt a bit like catching a bus which is fine for business travel i guess onboard the outbound flight wa less than half full ba s embraer fleet are pretty new and clean the e is a fun little plane to travel in with steep ascent out of lcy and some tight turn cabin crew excellent and a small snack shortbread popcorn or crisp and drink were served on this minute flight immigration and baggage reclaim at rtm is a breeze on the return leg onboard service wa excellent a it wa an evening flight the free bar service wa much appreciated arrival at lcy wa a shamble the flooded toilet being particularly unpleasant shame they don t fly to rotterdam from heathrow though t is far more pleasant than lcy,positive
toronto to london sleeper service mean you can have a buffet dinner in the lounge rather than onboard the plane to maximise rest time excellent flight lhr fast track system allowed for speedy connection onto my flight to berlin heathrow to berlin a pleasant flight with excellent service the negative issue is that british airway business class seat selection cost extra if done in advance,positive

washington to dubai return via heathrow on british airway outbound segment on an a and three others on refurbished b aircraft a a regular year customer and a gold level executive club member one ha to expect much variation in the ba onboard product staff are generally polite and hardworking some are not very well trained so seem to lack the extra attention to detail that should come with club world the fish main course served between iad and lhr wa unbelievably bad but other meal were fairly good high tea without scone clotted cream and strawberry jam is an absurd cost cutting measure on a british airline a i discovered on the lhr iad sector it is sad to see this airline not working harder in response to the competition,negative

istanbul to london heathrow with british airway the main reason i pay to travel business class is to get extra leg room ba s club europe now give you exactly the same leg room a in economy which may be okay for a quick hop to paris but is definitely unsatisfactory on this near four hour flight it wa particularly annoying to see child sitting in row the only row with reasonable leg room service wa fine and the food quite good but no entertainment at all from now on i ll book economy and pay for exit seat it s a no brainer either that or fly turkish airline an airline which is going from strength to strength,positive

abu dhabi to heathrow seating narrow and uncomfortable but seems to be the norm with this aircraft with most airline cabin crew excellent but when they move friend or british airway employee from economy to premium economy or business class after boarding is complete they should do so discreetly without fare paying passenger noticing the food served ha declined in quality and quantity the english breakfast used to be one of the best meal in economy on ba now there is no bacon in it but rubbery mushroom and the scrambled egg equally rubbery truly awful meal flight on time and entertainment system getting better at least the screen on this newer aircraft are bigger than those on the ancient s still operated by british airway,positive

british airway ha completely terrible customer service i paid extra to fly ba instead of one of the cheaper airline assuming some sort of quality of experience the flight is more than hour delayed with no reasoning and they refuse to book customer on another flight that ha room on it and is departing earlier because it is closed and willing to make the customer miss their connecting flight instead of finding a solution to a problem people are extremely rude don t provide any information to customer and don t provide any sort of solution to make the experience any better avoid this airline at all cost if possible unless you have a lot of free time and patience,negative

my first long haul flight with british airway for some year and what a mistake i flew premium economy expecting it to be on par with it competitor especially lufthansa or virgin atlantic not so at all at the airport it took over hour to check in there wa no dedicated premium economy check in nor a premium economy boarding queue at the gate either perhaps the plane would be a little special no not at all it wa an old boeing that had been designed to maximise seat at the expense of comfort the cramped space of the premium economy cabin with it seating wa comparable to economy and wa light year behind the modern and spaciousness of other airline and sitting in a middle row seat meant you could not physically squeeze past the person next to you to the aisle unless you woke the person up or you took your chance to stand over them and hope you manoeuvred successfully stupidly i had thought that competition would eliminate most difference between airline how wrong i wa avoid british airway on the hong kong route if you are flying on a boeing my advise is to check the plane type before booking or you will suffer an expensive hour flight reminiscent of over year ago,negative

one feature of british airway these day is that it product can be so variable on this basis i had low expectation of a recent flight from heathrow to athens the plane wa an old and being phased out however the crew were professional and attentive food wa good plenty of drink available and the inflight entertainment comprised the latest star war movie given the very low price i paid for the ticket no complaint my worry is the accountant that run the airline and always chipping away at the soft product,negative
copenhagen to accra via london heathrow after a chaotic boarding the flight lhr acc wa smooth with comfortable seat which felt softer than the newer and narrower food wa good the attitude of cabin staff positive and professional and the movie selection good i wa however surprised by the smaller audio selection than experienced on previous flight especially concerning rhytmical music hour before landing a second serving took place it wa a good experience flying ba and i do not hesitate in recommending this airline only concern is the limited space for hand luggage ba should more strictly control the hand luggage of the passenger is within the limit given way too many passsengers ignored this on this and the return flight,positive

stockholm to london heathrow wa not a pleasant experience british airway ha a good way of reminding you that you re flying cattle class the interior wa tired and worn and the seat wa hard the legroom wa inadequate for a short haul flight the cabin service wa variable while some were courteous others practically barked at you one steward even tapped me and gestured me for a refill on the bright side there seems to be a lot of generosity with alcohol i have had the fortune of sitting in front of three very loud and progressively intoxicated lady who pressed for the stewardess for more alcohol every minute on the flight request promptly obliged perhaps i should have taken the advantage of this generosity to make the flight more bearable,positive

flew from edi lhr phl lhr edi in world traveller outbound shuttle to heathrow wa a boeing in all economy layout managed to bag seat f g using online checkin cheery friendly crew biggest problem is the excessive hand baggage allowance permitted on ba selfish people take huge case on board filling up the locker so everyone with more modestly sized item can t get a look in cabin crew quite stressed trying to move case around locker to get everyone sat down lhr phl upgraded to the rearmost group of two seat on row on boeing ba ha now cheekily increased the cost of these to each used to be only like the rest of the cabin wisecracking captain over the tannoy made the flight a little more entertaining again great crew i could eat the meal for once only thing that went wrong wa the ife on my seat crashed in the last minute of the flight i could only view the flight tracker on a side note i wish ba would upgrade the album choice they haven t changed it in the last year flight wa on time no delay inbound phl lhr i reserved a seat for each but note you cannot buy the back row on the middle group reserved for the crew plane encountered severe turbulence between nantucket and newfoundland crew had to rush the drink and the meal service a a result no apology from the pilot about this which ba usually doe lhr edi problem about excessive hand baggage exacerbated on the smaller a it wa the same steward by sheer coincidence that served u on the outbound shuttle a week earlier and he did remember u and asked u how our holiday in philadelphia went otherwise flight wa pleasant and did what it said on the tin overall it wa a good value trip i booked it through ba holiday and it being off season meant the total cost wa before seat upgrade including day car rental one observation however it that it is now clear that ba care little about it economy passenger who now seem to exist to make up the number everything now seems to be geared around their high spending executive club member avios earning ha been drastically cut in the world traveller cabin class so a discounted fare now only attracts avios in the mile therefore a transatlantic flight to the east coast of the usa which used to get point now only attracts a measily pretty pathetic really i really only use british airway via lhr for usa trip purely on the basis of using large widebody plane unlike american and united who increasingly use boeing s and their holiday deal which are hard to beat and enable payment instalment,positive

washington to heathrow with british airway and i have to say that the iad ground crew and inflight crew are fantastic i sprained my neck just day before departure and wa given the option to pre board which made all the difference the flight itself wa amazing the a is just like a rock in the sky i didn t feel a thing the seat comfort on the upper deck in coach is more than adequate in fact it reminds me of economy plus on united the premium economy is more like domestic business class on most u carrier older style business class not the new business first the major downside a i write this in the middle of my trip is the ground staff at heathrow they are hard to find if they even exist i m in the middle of a terminal to terminal connection still wearing my brace and when asking about gate assignment and better option for seating the best i got wa a brusque sorry that s all there is when you see someone limping away from your desk at least ask if they d like some assistance getting to the departure lounge i know that with united they may not offer club access for free but you can at least buy it and i have found their ground staff at heathrow far superior to the uk s flagship carrier unfortunately,positive

british airway from manchester to rio de janeiro via heathrow weren t invited to the lounge at man due to a rather arrogant check in agent the concord lounge at lhr ha seen better day ordered a bacon sandwich which arrived far too promptly and wa limp and rather pathetic so left it champagne on boardng wa warm a wa the water nut were pleasant seat area wa genuinely filthy and had not been thoroughly cleaned with remnant of the toiletry bag between the seat from the last passenger first choice of food not available which is unacceptable in first then a whole row of seat just stopped working so my seat wa in a permanent degree incline staff attempted to get them working but to no avail we ended being split up partner on row me on row nice start to our honeymoon thanks ba cheese selection on the menu had changed and wa offered a scrappy piece of paper to advise new selection staff upgrade are commonplace on ba in first and the cabin had by my reckoning paying passenger and i d say about staff upgrade all of whom appeared after we had been pushed back from the gate these mate of crew are showered with attention throughout the flight personally i d have preferred to see some of the full fare business class passenger upgraded with staff passenger thankful for a seat but ba seem to think it s acceptable for staff to travel in first if you re on flying on business and hoping for an upgrade i d say you re chance are pretty remote unless of course you know one of the crew for that flight a pretty poor experience all round which prof that the once world favourite airline ha become so complacent that they can t even get it right in first class is it any wonder the middle east carrier are showing the rest of the world how to do it,positive

our first time flying to dominican republic and found the best deal with british airway and the benefit wa it is a direct flight from gatwick to punta cana on the outbound flight the plane wa half empty so it wa nice and spacious the ba boeing is an outdated plane which ha been used in their fleet for many year and ha not had a refurb i would say in about year i suppose this is why the flight wa so cheap the staff on board were friendly and efficient the seat pitch is large so i could sit for hour comfortably the seat despite the plane being old were comfortable and not showing sign of wear the entertainment system is what show the age of the plane one of the smallest screen in the industry they are very small and the anti glare screen is hard to see from you need to keep adjusting the brightness of the screen throughout the movie the range of movie wa good food wa ok nothing special and not really a choice,positive

flight got off to a good start with a reasonable dinner in the malaysian airline first class lounge i wa looking forward to my first flight on the boeing so much so i switched from singapore lhr to kl when i discovered the operated on this route the new plane is very nice indeed the so called new new first is not ba trumpet they have listened to customer and this revised version wa to be the new pace setter wrong the fa on the route were great and dinner wa adequate the chicken satays followed by prawn and mango salad wa fine the wine wa also fine the cheap champagne nowhere near to krug a served by other carrier in st class the usual cheap stainless steel cutlery and boring glassware and chinaware we have to get used to the seat is definitely more constrained than the and a st class it tighter and smaller in bed mode it is like sleeping on a park bench so hard the ridiculous island design for the table and retractable dinning table is worse than the and a when lying on your side it dig into your back the seat s narrow profile becomes very obvious you have to be a gymnast to get into and out of the compartment i am tall and not overweight i did not sleep hardly at all when compared with the a flight i took to singapore last month the tv screen is larger and fixed which doe not lend itself to a companion dinning with you a on the other aircraft it on a slight angle a well slightly facing away from the viewer the av remote is small and overly complicated there is no wifi there is no window blind a on the other aircraft the window can be dimmed to black so you have two black orb staring at you through the flight ba seem clueless when it come to a top end st class i will avoid this plane in future a jaw dropping disappointment,negative

london heathrow to vancouver with british airway outbound flight wa delayed by hour email wa received on the day of travel it did take call to the airline to establish if one could arrive later on the first call there wa such a poor understanding of the question that the operator thought we wanted to rebook flight fortunately we were cut off a i think the call might have continued for the rest of the day second call wa more successful and a direct answer wa given no matter how unwelcome printing your own baggage label wa a new experience at lhr i am not a frequent air traveller a sign of the time perhaps but i did get the impression of going through a self checkout at a supermarket not much to say about bag drop off it wa neither efficient nor inefficient just a linear series of a few task performed by someone doing their job the young chap at drop off said that the delay started a minute at the beginning of the week which had turned into two hour by friday at the gate i did wonder why those with priority boarding moved to a different seating area all of metre away i suspect people need to be seen receiving value for higher ticket price because they will of course get there first the flight wa just about adequate my video screen did not work and despite request to cabin crew this wa not rectified well i wa ignored fortunate a the film and tv choice wa poor i do not like airline food that much there are plenty of food outlet past security to get something decent to eat never really drink the wine beer and spirit hard to get wrong return flight wa only made better by the jet stream reducing the flight time by an hour again the flight wa just about adequate did not eat the food a i had a salad from an outlet at yvr good value flight attendant said it looked better than what they were serving the seat in front of me wa broken so it reclined further than it should the only solution provided by another attendant wa to get up walk around a bit and stand at the back whilst the broken seat wa not the fault of the passenger in front she did not want to be reasonable the attendant stood there waiting for me to derive a solution,negative

gatwick is not my first choice but for naples with british airway it is the only choice so we reluctantly booked a return club europe ticket for a treat check in fast and friendly and fast track wa amazing we were the only people using it the ba lounge at gatwick have been closed and we were sent to the no lounge which ba is using instead to say it is less good is an understatement for a glass of champagne whereas free in the old ba lounge is just ridiculous the atmosphere is more weatherspoons than fortnum and mason and the crowd wa noisy and chaotic if what we were told is true the lounge will be used until next year we will be avoiding it next time and probably avoiding ba in that case food wa small portion and service bordering on rude from the barman who explained very impolitely that they do not serve diet drink once on board the crew were welcoming and friendly and the afternoon tea adequate but not exactly filling disappointing after the rubbish we were served in the lounge return flight from naples began with another abysmal lounge experience windowless crowded and with very limited food and drink again not worth the bother crew again were wonderful and very chatty and friendly new layout a and we had booked a and c totally unacceptable seat no bulkhead so right up by the main boarding door no carpet just a rubber floor and during boarding i wa constantly bashed by people bag and during the flight my foot were trodden on by people waiting for the toilet nowhere to stow my single bag because everyone else had two or more and had used all the space had to stow mine five row behind delaying my disembarkation dinner wa nice baggage last off the belt despite being priority tagged had it not been for the crew on both flight i would have thought the money wa wasted booking club europe lounge rubbish possibly the worst two lounge i have been in catering on board not bad and served nicely crew the only reason i would commend these two flight baggage service disappointing seat disappointing like the empty middle seat but front row wa awful,positive

toronto to heathrow my last flight with british airway check in and security efficient and quick lounge wa fine and the food provided for pre flight dinner wa tasty and perfectly adequate departure about minute late but this time wa made up with a hr min trip cabin comfort and service pretty much the norm for british airway business class no storage around the seat and the ife screen did not work a usual breakfast ha improved slightly the fruit wa varied and edible croissant warm but the bacon and egg muffin wa unfortunately cold arrival process fine,positive

my first time in first class on any airline joined the flight from a connection so didn t do first check in but boarded without incident met at the door by the purser greeted by name and shown to my seat mass of space very comfortable and private given it is semi open not a huge amount of storage around the seat but my case fitted into my personal locker at the front of my seat my partner and i were in e f at the back of the cabin front of the lower deck no disturbance from the galley choose a window seat if travelling alone being a day flight we didn t have bed made up the cabin is classic yet contemporary and elegant pre departure drink included grand siecle champagne we both chose the tasting menu option i didn t like the lobster starter and staff substituted a course from the a la carte menu food wa outstanding and wine pairing worked well to be a bit fussy the steak wa overcooked to the point of being unenjoyable ife wa good although no time to watch movie the screen is attached to the side of the seat and ha to be docked for take off and landing a in club world which is very irritating first off the plane although that doesn t matter much a immigration at mia is always a nightmare i ve flown ba for many year in other cabin and cost cutting is evident everywhere their club world is a joke compared to every long haul competitor but first is still a world leader i wa very pleased to fly ba and relieved that they still have it when it come to cosseting in first class i paid for this flight a part of a return itinerary but took the train from london to paris to start flew club europe from there to heathrow and then economy class back to paris on american airline this wa significantly cheaper than flying directly from heathrow still not cheap but well worth it and looking forward to the next time my recommendation is for first class the other cabin are average at best although i will still be flying ba regularly,positive
british airway business class from edinburgh to la vega return via heathrow cabin crew on both flight were very helpful and attentive part of the business class cabin on the is located in the upper cabin with seat and two dedicated crew the seating configuration however is just odd the window seat face backwards and aisle street face forward there is a privacy screen but if you are not travelling with a friend or family member you ll be looking at a complete stranger for the duration of your flight the cabin crew have to stretch over the person in the aisle seat to serve drink and meal if you have a window seat you have no option either but to climb over the person in the row behind you if they have their seat in flatbed position on arrival at la vega after an hour or so wait at the carousel with at least a hundred people including myself didn t get their luggage thereafter we all had to wait in line whilst british airway staff dealt with a very tired and annoyed group of people a gesture wa welcomed but this didn t really compensate for the inconvenience return flight with speedy check in and great service onboard,negative

this wa the return leg of our british airway flight on ba from johannesburg to london heathrow on th january while the majority of staff onboard where courteous and friendly it wa the behaviour of one individual within the crew who wa serving my husband that left u both feeling extremely incensed that we had paid a lot of money to basically be served by a moody petulant crew member she is blatantly in the wrong job because she had zero customer service skill and treated u a if we were a major inconvenience to her british airway may have some great crew who go out of their way to make your flight a positive enjoyable experience but if you are unfortunate enough to experience the above negative behaviour this make you anti booking future flight with this company is this really the way ba want it customer to feel being a member of cabin crew requires a range of skill if you present yourself a a friendly amiable part of the team giving your passenger a great flight surely you can walk away knowing you have fulfilled your part instead of putting so much energy into giving so little after all isn t it u the customer who choose to fly with you and support you a an airline check in crew at johannesburg could also do with training on manner and smiling instead of zero greeting no thank you s and blank face,positive

la vega to london with british airway wa awful we were in first class travelling with young child and wanted to put them to bed on this long flight and we had booked a row of seat so we could sleep one child one adult we check in at first class which wa delayed a they are busy and have moved some economy passenger to the first class line to speed up thing then we are told one of our seat ha been moved the staff are unsure a to why and will rectify this immediately and bring my boarding pas to the lounge an hour later i go to the check in desk a nobody from ba ha been bothered to come i am then told actually your seat is broken nothing we can do and it now my problem this seat is in the middle therefore it mean either one child alone on the otherside of the cabin or the child together behind me and my husband alone the other side of the cabin no other option and british airway are not prepared to ask anyone to swap seat so we can sit together on different row we kept the child together behind me obviously meaning i could not sleep the whole flight and my husband wa alone then the lamp on my child seat malfunctioned and wa on full beam the whole night flight keeping one of them awake the attendents were unable to override the light seriously they did offer to seat my child at the front of the cabin in a different seat alone surrounded by stranger or to move me to the front which would have left my child completely alone on out outward flight from london to vega one of our seat also malfunctioned and the tv etc went down for the entire journey nothing the cabin staff could do then either apparently they are old plane we are still waiting for a response from british airway,negative
munich to new york jfk via london in club europe and premium economy after flying up front on long haul trip for the last year i plucked up the courage to give british airway world traveller plus a try first gallery lounge at lhr wa good and had my fill from the very good food and drink upon boarding i wa disappointed to find that the cabin wa yet to be retrofitted with the new allegedly much better product despite it age the seat wa comfortable but the only good feature is the foot rest which is quite adaptable and help when trying to get some sleep ife ha improved in the last month with about current film although the screen is dated both in respect of size and resolution a a gold card holder i expected a bit more personalized service there wa no recognition of my status at all crew were experienced and delivered a good service despite a full cabin food tandoori chicken or beef cheek wa excellent and virtually a club world meal in fact it wa better than previous club world meal i ve had on recent trip all in all good value for money when not paying full fare and given that club world is so mediocre premium economy is adequate for flight hour or under,positive
watch out for fog diversion at pisa we arrived over pisa on time circled for minute and then diverted to genoa this wa because of fog at pisa and the fact that there wa no instrument landing system we subsequently found that the il ha not been working for some time and will not be working for a good while yet fog is common at pisa in the winter we could understand a last minute diversion because of unexpected factor however there have been frequent diversion yet british airway gave no advance warning that there might be trouble we had a long wait at a deserted genoa airport and no british airway or other staff were on hand to assist or offer drink or food eventually one lady appeared to show u to a bus which took u on a hour journey to pisa we had a hour day with little to eat or drink our chief complaint is that with advance warning from ba we would have bought water and food if we had known what could happen in any event ba should have done more to provide extra refreshment,negative
british airway flight from london heathrow to glasgow shabby cabin lacklustre cabin crew flight deck crew whose announcement were mainly less than informative a crew which appeared to be going through the motion with little enthusiasm and a little engagement with passenger a possible some time after the cabin crew had closed all of them the overhead locker above my seat fell open before the plane even moved off stand at lhr on descent into gla it opened again and hung open for several minute and i wa tempted to unclip and close it i made the passenger across the aisle aware in case the bag fell out on top of him eventually the cabin crew member whose jump seat faced up that aisle got up and closed it we should have been sitting upfront given our ticket class part of a longer trip but after service issue with ba and a long journey prior to this flight we couldn t be bothered pointing that out just another shabby experience to add to the other disappointment with regard to service and lounge provided by ba on a long return trip involving two other airline who were street ahead in all way,negative
malta to gatwick i have gripe about british airway pre flight charge i had to pay for checked baggage and to change seat but in my case the total cost of the flight wa only slightly higher than an equivalent ryanair flight and the difference in comfort and service is worth the extra cost cabin wa clean and the new slimline seat were quite comfortable crew wa upbeat and polite and served a snack and a well packed lunchbox i wish ba would offer inflight wifi and power outlet but if all ba flight are this good and only a bit more expensive than ryanair easyjet i will fly with them more often,positive

this wa my first time on british airway flying from tel aviv to philadelphia via london the seat were a comfortable a economy class can be expected to be though i would ve liked the headphone jack to be on the front of the armrest rather than on the inside which led to the jack on my headphone getting bent and ruined food wa pretty good the best part of my british airway experience wa the avod system flight were on time except for the expected delay at heathrow my only major complaint is the tax and fee that british airway charge even with award ticket it almost negates the benefit of using an award ticket all told british airway is better than u s airline but not at the level of iberia which i flew on my way to tel aviv and probably well below emirate singapore and the world s best airline,positive

bangkok to london with british airway on rd january this wa most probably the worst flight i ve had in year the crew were very poor only seeing them when serving meal no one came round with drink or snack during a hour flight if you wanted anything you had to go to the galley and then they were unhelpful i wa only offered a bag of crisp the seat wa very narrow and the remote for the entertainment wa on top of the armrest food wa below the the standard i would expect from a national airline small portion main meal and a pice of cake no offer for a second cup of coffee overall a most unpleasant experience i would not recommend british airway to anyone,negative
my partner and i traveled british airway from gatwick to punta cana on th december after checking in online and paying an extra each way per person to reserve seat after already paying over for our flight wasn t a major issue and wa expected we discovered that selecting our outgoing seat wa fine but our return seat had only seat left both on opposite side of the cabin being a nervous flyer i wa not up for sitting by myself for nearly hour so we decided to try to discus the issue at our baggage drop off point the gentleman working behind the drop off wa a helpful a he could be but basically said that we would have to raise the issue when we left punta cana and that it wasn t likely for u to be able to do anything because remaining seat would be left for business and first class traveller getting onto the plane we were the first one to be called up to board before economy which wa good but getting onto the aircraft we discovered an extremely dated plane with tv screen the size of my iphone and worn tatty seat with not a much leg room a other airline we have flown premium economy after take off we were given a meal with the only option being chicken or beef which wa okay flight attendant then offered u drink once we had our drink gave u at the same time two bottle of sparkling wine which we hadn t asked for and we were happy with and thought that perhaps the service would make up for the dated flight but then hour into the flight we had seen absolutely no staff whatsoever and had soon discovered from overheard conversation that a lot of the onboard staff s family were on board and they were all staying in punta cana for day before flying home one member of staff appeared around hour into the flight and gave their family and friend champagne from first class and walked past everybody else my partner then asked a staff member for glass of water and we were told we would have to walk to the back of the economy cabin to get them when we arrived at the back of the crowded economy cabin we discovered several staff fast asleep and had to wake somebody for water hour before descending we were given tea and coffee and sandwich which were fine all staff in our cabin looked half asleep with hair all over the place considering this wa a pm flight you d have thought it wa an evening flight we arrived in punta cana at pm extremely disapointed with the poor service and the dated plane we had endured for almost hour,positive
london to johannesburg return with british airway this wa my first ever long haul flight to see my daughter get married in zimbabwe i wa in for a big shock and not a nice one the seat and room were not really any different to low cost airline and this wa an hour flight jammed in like sardine and got no sleep freezing cold aircon all the way back from johannesburg and again so cramped that when the person in front of you put the seat back you cannot eat your food i used a connecting flight to bulawayo which wa with south african airlink and even though it wa only a hour flight the food wa much better and the plane far more comfortable a very poor experience with british airway and gbp spent for the of u to get there and back i will never be disapointed with ryanair or easyjet again british airway are trading on their name only,negative

copenhagen to chicago via london heathrow british airway club world is the worst business class cabin i ve flown tv are tiny and the picture quality is awful thankfully i had my laptop with me a the tv wa unwatchable the table hang at an angle so expect your food and drink to slide off although the floor is probably the best place for their food i would advise you to eat at the airport and not rely on the inflight slop you ll have someone climbing over you or you ll have to climb over other people to get to the toilet this is business class and then they ll lose your bag tell you it s going to take day to get it to you and provide no information about what to do in the meantime if you try and call to get answer leave at least minute time to sit in a queue and then expect to be put through to the wrong person despite selecting the correct option in the automated menu avoid british airway wherever you can,negative
british airway from vienna to newcastle via heathrow return flight on time economy on an a fa s much better on domestic leg while both time on vie leg the fa s were professional but nothing more and not doing more than absolutely required information from the flight deck wa friendly and excellent a snack and drink were served snack a highly processed sandwich barely edible on the vie flight and crisp biscuit on the ncl flight additional drink on request a featured the new slim seat and i miss the older more comfortable ba seat with better leg room ba ha recently changed the rule and travelling only with hand baggage now also mean that one is no longer allowed to pick a seat during check in but a seat is randomly allocated selecting any seat even a middle seat in the back of plane now cost eur if one later decides to check a piece of luggage the cost are a whopping eur at the airport or eur online being oneworld sapphire doe not help either no privilege here still the same charge for seat selection and checked luggage so ba became a low cost model except for drink service however the price do not reflect this change in service on the last leg lhr vie carry on luggage wa heavily policed although my carry on luggage met the weight requirement and fit in the overhead bin and ha so without any problem on the previous three leg and twenty previous ba flight i wa required to check it in it wa also not a question of occupied space a it happened in the priority line hopefully just a power trip by the gate agent however here go the main advantage of ba which wa a carry on policy that enabled passenger to realistically travel without the hassle of checking bag boarding by the same agent wa again bizarre instead of priority boarding there were now four different type of priority boarding and the procedure left everybody confused and everybody just stood there blocking the access to the gate so that finally it became a cattle call with everyone boarding at the same time another thing is that recent change in ba s frequent flyer program make it impossible to reach a meaningful status even for regular flyer unless you regularly fly club on long distance route obviously ba is trying very hard to annoy it frequent traveler while i stopped flying business with ba probably a year ago after they downgraded their club europe cabin and i wa avoiding their long distance flight for a long time due to their terrible seating arrangement i believe ba s european economy wa a great product and i wa using ba regularly for those flight however after all these recent change i will only book ba if they offer the lowest or close to the lowest fare for flight to the uk klm start to look pretty good again,positive
london heathrow to barcelona and for some reason british airway continue to run this barcelona service from the dated terminal at heathrow rather than new t that apart this service wa fine boarding wa quick and efficient seat in economy are now pretty similar to those on low cost airline but this handluggage only ticket cost no more than one with ryanair from stansted would have food and drink wa the now standard minimalist option on most european flight these day just one question why when this is the british national flag carrier doe the drink trolley not stock some british beer rather than identikit continental fizzy lager departure and arrival in bcn wa on schedule and exiting the airport a breeze,positive
london to newcastle been a while since i last flew british airway sad to see the same old plane in use and now very much looking their age for domestic use technical issue delayed departure normal sure but the noise the plane made on taxi lasted far too long and wa slightly alarming and not the norm seat pitch belongs on a dodgy charter not the national carrier surely last time flown i got a nice sandwich and drink this time it s small bag of crisp and juice it s time ba stopped taking it s domestic no competition route for granted and upgrade the fleet on short trip the number onboard justify a better level of service considering the extra fee now attached for checked in luggage versus just carry on put me off using their long haul option with ever increasing fee whilst oil price have been rock bottom for how long now kudos to the pilot for landing in monsoon like condition with very limited visibility if only the aircraft quality matched their pilot,positive

i booked a non refundable round trip ticket new york to london paris to new york i showed up at jfk hour before my flight and wa informed that my ticket had been refunded which meant i had no ticket when i spoke to british airway customer service they said they would investigate how this happened which would take hour but that meanwhile i had no ticket they would not rebook my ticket they were entirely unsympathetic even though they had made a huge error cancelling my ticket i wa forced to purchase an expensive last minute ticket for which i have still not been reimbursed even though finally british airway acknowledged that they had made a big error i can understand making an error i cannot understand their unwillingness to help me when they put me in such a compromised position subsequent to the problem on first leg british airway customer service assured me that my return ticket wa not affected and they even sent me an e ticket confirmation of my return but again the morning of my return flight they told me i had no return ticket only then did a supervisor finally admit that an error had been made and he rebooked my return at no cost over the course of week however i spent at least hour trying to get my problem sorted out first at heathrow airport then on the phone and on email and i wa still left stranded for my return flight i am amazed that british airway wa so insensitive to the problem which they created through a huge error and that i have still not received a refund for the outbound ticket i wa forced to purchase,negative

phoenix to london heathrow and this wa our third time flying first class on british airway and after flying this time we are disappointed the ba lounge in phoenix is disgusting we could handle it only for about minute from the staff the seat the space the food nothing wa orderly clean and it all seemed run down walking around the airport aimlessly wa a much better option the boarding process wa a joke again the staff seemed confused clueless they called for everyone all status membership traveling with child etc all at once it seemed nearly half of the plane wa lined up to get in during premier boarding there were cabin staff for first class two out of the three were not at all cordial no greeting they seemed to be running around the entire time even when the first class cabin wa not full they were not well groomed or spoke politely came across unprofessional this ruined the experience of flying first class the meal experience wa horrible i ordered an appetizer salad and an main course my husband ordered the appetizer and a main course they came back to tell u they were out of one of the appetizer he ordered first time this ha ever happened in first class they brought my appetizer which we had to share and they completely forgot about my salad they brought the main chicken dish which wa cold and dry i had to send it back and changed to a steak the steak came after about minute roughly of the steak wa hot the remainder wa cold not even warm the taste wa amazing but ruined the dining experience completely upon waking up i opted to not have breakfast but have biscuit the menu had assortment of biscuit and a few other bistro type item when i ordered coffee and biscuit the flight attendant looked concerned and said let me see if i can find some biscuit for you she came back with a bag of popcorn a browny and a few vanilla wafer typical item served on a domestic u based airline my husband ordered coffee a well and asked for half and half she failed to understand half and half and finally said oh you mean half and half in british accent how is it possible to be a flight attendant and you cannot understand an american accent for half and half normally this would not even be an issue but having experienced all of the above this just seemed like the icing on the cake toilet were small cramped and dirty with no typical first class amenity available within the toilet our next leg wa within eu to munich on another ba flight where the service on a surpassed their international first class seat is comfortable but that s about it,negative

third time flying the british airway a and the only reason that we did is because it wa a ba amex for redemption however to ensure that we maxed out the experience a always we pre booked seat on checking in online seat had been moved contacted ba bronze and reply wa cannot answer why possibly operational reason more information should be available at check in check in no response on board our seat were occupied by what appeared to be normal passenger i e no entourage seat we were allocated lumbar and head rest function did not operate cabin crew tried rebooting but no luck so onwards and upwards having flown ba a reasonable amount i have come to the conclusion that the cabin crew despite operating with poorly designed cabin poorly maintained seat equipment we had a similar scenario on a heathrow to la and return last july where we had the same reg plane same seat and similar problem which wa not fixed after the flight out manage to maintain a brave company face ba club lounge again food choice poor running out although granted peak hour but if other airline can cope why cannot ba cabin crew service very good and friendly food reasonable but nothing that make you say that that wa good entertainment poor old ish and second rate movie enough said seat unfortunately in this case we leave the worst till last having flown qantas emirate and qatar a s like everybody else we wonder why ba did not take the opportunity for a redesign of layout and seat area well we know why s question doe no one on the ba cabin design team wear glass there is no storage space if it go in the drawer with the shoe you have to move the seat from sleep position to access so you are left with the possibility of either wearing and damaging said spec or hanging them over the separator again competitor manage it the seat itself is harder than the competitor above mattress and apparently i discovered that extra pillow are no longer carried so you have one and thats it unfortunately we do still have to use ba next march but have booked qatar again for october additionally the customer service service in india is sadly woefully short in all area although polite working from script and unable to solve answer simple question frustration a question for ba we really want to support and be proud of our national flag carrier but what are the incentive for using ba i do not mean cost,negative

recently flew to la on british airway and wa thoroughly underwhelmed with the experience on the ba a i travel regularly in business class on emirate normally on the same equipment the ba configuration upstairs is quite cramped and far inferior to other airline even to the extent of having to stretch over other passenger to leave your seat in addition the staff seem preoccupied with their own arrangement and although were fine with me were mildly irritated with the request of other passenger openly commenting to each other in front of me the cleanliness of the plane also left a lot to be desired after only a couple of hour into the flight the toilet were disgusting with the floor awash i don t think crew check them on a regular basis the window seat ha side stowage facility which in my case had a disgusting pale yellow fluid and rubbish in it when mentioned to crew they did get some paper towel to dry it out but needless to say i didn t use it photo attached overall poor value for money,negative

washington to dubai via london return with british airway my concern is regarding seat allocation when we booked our flight adult one child and one infant the seat with the bassinet for the infant were not available we then chose seat together on the side i presumed that those are granted first come first served based on the need of the passenger that are traveling with child nonetheless in out of the flight we took those seat were taken by single individual with no child infant accompanying them i asked at the check in if the seat with the bassinet were occupied by people with infant and the ground attendant responded by yes that wa not the case unfortunately the flight were therefore very uncomfortable due to not having a place for the infant while food and drink were served i do not understand that when you try to book those seat with the bassinet the system doe not grant priority to the people traveling with infant british airway should consider that instead of having passenger with the hassle of keeping their infant on their lap for hour while the bassinet are empty the priority seating chart is for that purpose useful,positive

british airway online check in policy is now most appalling four time i have flown with them and three time myself and my girlfriend have been placed apart this is even though we were on the same booking and once this ha happened in business british airway charge you just for selecting a seat not a better seat just any seat other than that automatically selected for you the system seems designed to deliberately place you apart even though it know that you are together then it charge you per seat to change your seat if neither you or your partner have an empty seat next to you then you have to pay to move both seat just to be together they also won t let you checkin until hour before so you have to spend one hour of your holiday going online and paying for the privilege of sitting together both these practice are archaic even with ryanair they place you together in the system and if you pay to change you get priority boarding monarch only charge you to get a better quality seat with ryan air you can also checkin your return at the same time a your outward british airway have sunk to new depth and i will not fly them again,positive

checked in and found the club lounge wa landside meaning one had to allow time to get through security after using it i need not have worried a i spent all of second in the shared lounge that british airway use with about eight airline a ba have daily flight to hannover and potentially user of the facility i could have been forgiven to thinking there might be some decent food around wrong the meal wa a bunch of dried up sausage in a steamer that looked like sample in a medical lab ghastly a few bit of cheese here and there and that wa it i quickly moved on and had an excellent dinner in the movenpick restaurant a few meter away only three passenger in club and the plane pushed back minute early the meal i wa offered wa a reasonable looking prawn salad i declined a i wa well fed a couple of gin and tonic and the flight of minute passed easily fa very friendly landing wa in high wind and very well executed wa the return trip worth it for not really but then my client paid the bill,positive
dublin to london city on nd november flight wa cancelled due to fog queued for hour for a rebooking only to be offered a flight on the following evening when fog wa due again in london refund could not be processed by staff in the airport so i had to phone the call centre two week later and i still have not received a refund booked ryanair for the following day and even though it wa last minute it wa still cheaper than my original cancelled ba flight reluctant to pay a premium to fly british airway again,negative
trip got off to a good start with the club lounge at terminal and i prefer it to t decent seating reasonable food and plenty of drink plane wa newish and in good shape wa seated in a so leg room wa fine anywhere else in club europe is a waste of time and little space plane took off minute late fa were fine declined the miserable pathetic looking dried up sandwich which wa the inflight meal had a couple of gin and tonic instead comfortable flight of about minute,positive
this review cover my usual return trip from london heathrow to dubai both flight are overnight and i use point to upgrade to business it wa a boeing going out and boeing on the return trip there wa nothing really wrong with either flight but i only really use them for the timing and the flat bed to get some sleep i don t like the weird front to back x x layout and cannot forsee how much longer british airway can get away with this a it is so out of date with modern standard it is fine if you get a window seat and no one attached to you having watched the seating pattern filling up over several month i eventually paid extra to reserve a window seat both way after a couple of hour the bed is very hard and the storage is almost non existent that said the crew were polite and served well they seemed to be older and i think that make the difference they understand customer service on the return one cabin crew in particular wa very responsive and helpful in offering tea mid flight overall the product is outdated and this time the service wa good it got me there and back safely and i wa fed and watered i am very open to moving my custom elsewhere though primarily due to the seat layout,positive
check in both way wa excellent and priority security british airway lounge at heathrow and spa very nice a wa breakfast served there lounge at houston is far too small so many status holder in there that it became standing room only outbound plane we were due to fly on went tech min before departure so swapped and after delay of hour they got a new plane sadly neither plane nor interior were new the new first first class seat ageing badly grubby and scuffed seat electric hesitant to work at time and old entertainment system that failed during the flight interior much better on the way back crew excellent and attentive on way out food well presented but poor outbound better coming back wine same both way and rather average surprised the hand baggage allowance is same in all class now in first class you have an entire overhead to yourself and seat storage so why not allow first passenger to make use of it priority baggage labelling a always pointless came out in the middle of everyone elses the simple question to ask is wa it worth it if i had paid for it a no not a big enough upgrade on business class to justify the difference and not a first class experience in some important aspect,positive
i regularly travel british airway to lcy and lhr and found them to be nothing more than a glorified ryanair in term of service i also flew a longer sector kiev to london last week and it wa awful on the a they only have toilet at the rear of the plane for all economy passenger on a hour flight this resulted in massive queue discomforting passenger on the last row a well a long wait for those actually using the loo the food wa horrendous chicken kiev and the air hostess were surly abrupt and really uninterested and unfriendly i don t want them to do the fake smile and friendliness thing but these girl and guy were genuinely unhappy and unfriendly a for my regular weekly or biweekly flight between dublin and lcy or lhr the e service to lcy is ok it s punctual and you get a stale croissant for breakfast on it what really annoys me is how british airway treat it frequent flyer make it impossible to get any meaningful benefit from ba despite having travelled numerous time with them every other week at least and paid hundred of pound in fare that are usually well above the competition they also have this seat selection fee for their bronze member if they book a hand luggage only fare they cite that these fare are there to make it competitive but they really are not anywhere near competitive on route they sell from dublin and the treatment of regular flyer and bronze member leaf a lot to be desired it s basically meaningless i would have far better service on cityjet or aer lingus which both server those route for a lower fare while being able to choose my seat for free at check in time a a result i am seriously considering my use of british airway,positive
i decided to fly british airway a it is now the only oneworld carrier with premium economy between sydney and singapore since qantas now only run a s with business and basic economy into singapore it wa a pleasant surprise with very good service and food and a pleasant ambience onboard almost all passenger were flying onto london and this also applied to the return run from singapore with almost all passenger originating in london this mean that for the return flight from singapore most other people had slept all the way from london and were chatting and moving about the cabin meaning it wa almost impossible to get any sleep on the relatively short overnight flight between singapore to sydney so if you don t mind skipping any sleep between singapore and sydney this is a nice alternative when planning to fly from australia to singapore and return many passenger had their window blind shut during the landing approach into singapore and also sydney when i understood just the opposite wa supposed to be the case for safety reason not sure why ba allows this to happen,positive
athens to london heathrow return british airway really annoyed me with paying for seat selection a a result i try my luck and board the plane last without paying for seat selection for short haul flight it is worth the risk otherwise the usual british airway service food ha improved over the past few year pilot and cabin crew quite pleasant to interact with plane in decent condition,positive

cape town to london heathrow the new british airway lounge at cape town is a big improvement on the lounge that used to be shared with virgin however it filled up quickly with passenger for the two flight our new first class seat a a were already showing their age so the plane wa probably one of the first to be retrofitted unfortunately the crew in first were young and disinterested neither of u were addressed by our name at any point during the flight the dinner service wa slow and the food mediocre cold and dry or overcooked and dry ironically they ran out of the south african white wine the entertainment system wasn t working for most of the flight british airway should provide an ipad alternative in first when that happens pjs and the flat bed made up with a duvet are good touch but the flight wa too turbulent for uninterrupted sleep the boeing toilet are ridiculously small for changing in and out of clothes overall the experience wa underwhelming,positive
british airway are not the upmarket world class brand they were fact everything is about saving whilst extorting the lounge at gatwick and t had no hot food until certain time like school a while back they re wa always superb lounge food and not salty kettle chip people have paid for this and british airway is not delivering which is really wrong bought sandwich from downstairs because lounge had no decent food onboard only a tiny amount of club world passenger yet they ran out of preferred meal choice starting to wonder just how the cabin crew are treated because if they are treated the way passenger are no wonder they ve stopped caring so sad for what wa an iconic brand,negative
travelled british airway from london heathrow to buenos aire return in business class business class layout is terrible with very narrow seat which are arrangend in way that almost in any seat you book somebody will step over you during the night or you have to step over somebody else in addition there are screen between and your neighbor s seat which flight attendant have to move up and down when they want to serve passenger who do not have an aisle seat i can t imagine how stupid the person who created this layout must have been it is not comfortable for passenger nor is it for flight attendant very sticky atmosphere due to this odd arrangement of seat in term of service this wa lousy on both flight there are about flight attendant for about business class seat the flight attendant are quite old it take them a long time to get you something to drink on the table after take off they move through the cabin twice with drink before they serve dinner and desert afterwards you don t see them and they may not show up even if you press the call button their attitude is by and large correct but very formal and impersonal they clearly don t display any sign of fun or interest in the customer food wa reasonable no wifi available at all,positive
i have been loyal british airway and found little to complain about the last two long haul i have done this year with ba ha seen the passenger wearing winter coat when flying to the tropic due to the cabin being kept freezing but my main complaint is the nice little earner ba have come up with where you pay seat allocation and extra for bulkhead or emergency exit seat where there is more leg room i have now paid the high rate on numerous occasion only to find the plane configuration ha changed and i am in a regular seat the crew have been known to ask me for proof today s flight wa no exception i wasn t even given an apology or a refund but told to keep my voice down the crew looked tired and just going through the motion my loyalty may have come to an end and i am seriously considering air mauritius or emirate for my next trip,negative
flight and crew great the problem came when we had to deal with the orlando check in staff and customer complaint in uk total nightmare and they just did not care at all our seat were booked month in advance a we had a small baby with u when arriving at orlando airport to return home the check in agent changed our seat to mid row and no bassinet we noticed before going through security and returned to advise to get our seat that we had booked back this turned into hour of sheer hell with the staff including airport manager while my baby screamed the place down hungry a we could not go through security until they had rectified the problem the staff were rude and arrogant and refused to admit they had messed up and refused to change our seat back a they had seated someone else there who had no baby even though these seat are reserved for people with baby due to the bassinet availability eventually it wa changed back after so much stress and hassle on returning we complained and time we got the answer yes it wa our fault we are sorry but we can t give anything to say sorry for our behaviour eventually after another complaint they agreed to avios and voucher i won t be flying with british airway again a they are so bad in customer relation and check in agent leave a lot to be desired,negative
heathrow to la vega with british airway and a farcical flight to be honest hour into a hour flight running out of beer for those who drink is a joke not having the choice of food by the time it come to you on occasion over the flight is pathetic i guess you need to really consider where you book your seat by asking where they start serving from i thought air stewardess were meant to at least crack a smile once and again and when asked reasonable question that had to be asked due to the ridiculous shortage were meant to be a accommodating and friendly a possible hope i never have to fly with british airway again,positive
smooth take off and landing plane about full mostly business people the meal wa past terrible a horrible tiny dry bread bun with a the smallest piece of chicken ever and the most salty bacon i have ever tasted the best part wa the sticky bun that followed washed down with lemonade no entertainment for this hr min flight the toilet were barely passable had they been cleaned from the previous flight,negative
gatwick to venice with british airway the plane wa clean crew good and reasonably on time with good check in but the flight wa made unpleasant by ba encouraging people to take so much cabin baggage on to the plane the return flight wa perhaps full but the overhead locker were full it cause a scrum at boarding the back row passenger board first and stowed their case at the front so they don t have to carry them down the plane the locker are than full when the forward row boarded they had nowhere to stow theirs it wa then chaos while the cabin crew sorted it out it should be every passenger right to not have luggage under their foot,negative
round trip london to luanda in british airway business class club world it s really below average british airway seems stand still in the competition with other airline the seat are cramped there are no storage for personal item the seat and toilet were not adequately cleaned up after previous flight the food and ife were average for business class british airway should think about improving the cabin in general or otherwise they will continue to fall behind their competitor even american airline and iberia which practically owned by same company have improved a lot the only positive thing wa the fa in both leg were polite and courteous they were relatively young so they still have motivation to do their job,positive
not impressed with british airway at all we flew back from denver after visiting family we flew out with lufthansa a they were the cheapest a we usualy fly to the middle far east with them and know the standard and quality they have to offer our return lufthansa flight home wa cancelled due to flight attendant strike at lufthansa we were booked straight on to the ba flight back to london which left only an hour later initially we were excited to fly with british airway a it would ve been our first time flying with them and also they fly a b from denver to europe i am aware that the boeing isn t the newest aircraft however lufthansa had re done the interior with new seat and side panel so very up to date inside with british airway the whole interior wa very old and dirty the seat hadn t been changed and the tv s in the back of the seat were such poor quality it wa embarrassing the food wa of a poor standard chicken meal i had wa horrendous and even the flight attendant didnt know what she wa serving when asked what chicken dish it wa she replied some sort of curry thing when it wa actually chicken teryaki the air hostess wa rude the breakfast snack which wa served before landing wa also not very good and cereal bar wa rock hard british airway were double the price of lufthansa when we initially booked however i would never choose to fly with the again out of my own choice their boeing s are dated which is a massive shame stick to an airline you know well lufthansa are the best european airline all round that i have used and emirate wa the best internationally i hope this review wa helpful obviously i am aware some customer would have had a better experience than me on newer plane with different food and air hostess however be aware when booking with british airway a they are very over rated and not good value for money,negative
roundtrip with british airway from bangkok to london in club world really the only good thing to talk about is the baggage allowance the seat are horrid cramped and you feel like you re in a coffin if you have the backward facing window seat it s unbelievably cramped and when i pay more than x the economy ticket i expect a place to keep a water bottle when the seat is in bed mode the main meal outbound wa not heated and had to be returned the pre ordered beef on the inbound wa dry changed it for the cold king prawn salad with couscous only to be told it wa actually chicken the bathroom are hideous and there s no distinction between economy and business blocked washbasin tissue fibre all over the place stained wall and peeling finish crew outbound were older and very pleasant inbound wa a much younger crew and only one spanish lady wa truly aware of passenger need the rest were more intent on getting to bangkok to party than to serve passenger with a smile boarding at lhr they were all in the galley blocking access to the other side of the cabin chattering to each other and not one welcome or eye contact after entering the door the club word lounge meal offering at t were abysmal more like a school canteen if anyone from ba read these opinion then please do something about your dreadful ife it s archaic and that s being polite fuzzy small screen and if you choose a movie with subtitle they re illegible,positive
awful customer service my wife and i have flown with british airway for almost year i booked a flight through the executive club which we are member of nine month before travelling less than week later we realised we would need to cancel and after almost hour on the phone on hold i decided to hang up and do it online this seemed to be a simple process with a final message of we are processing your request after no confirmation at all i received my credit card statement to find a refund from ba of under my booking wa over after a call to customer service i wa i will not get any further refund or be able to reinstate the flight there wa nobody else to talk to and if i emailed any of the ba executive it would be forwarded to customer service and they would not reply i asked about ombudsman or arbitrator and wa informed that british airway doe not adhere to or listen to outside body over down the pan month before take off so plenty of time for ba to double their money on my seat never again,negative

bengaluru to heathrow my first long haul flight with british airway and i am not at all impressed the service level were disgusting no ear plug no eye shade even after request drink service only a showpiece asked for a virgin mary and wa give iced tomato juice with lemon when asked for other ingredient like worcestershire sauce tabasco salt and pepper i wa told that this wa the airline recipe my request for some salt and pepper to spice my drink wa refused saying that we do not stock them in economy when i requested for a talk with the head of staff on the aircraft he wa sorry and said the airline wa trying to cut corner and the crew plea were falling on deaf year only vegetarian dinner option provided since they had apparently run out no menu etc ife selection with dated screen and headset wa a low cost carrier experience that take a passenger from point a to point b without any feel good moment,negative

nice to la vega via heathrow overall british airway premium economy is a good product seat is great day seat but not really good to sleep in food wa average not sure why they insist on beef and then overcook service on the way wa terrific on the way back wa average the stewardess wa bitter and not happy entertaiment need to be updated a separate cabin and bathroom is a plus and the fact that you are behind first class cabin mean you get off right away all in all a good experience but with some thing that need to be fine tuned,positive
i recommend flying any other airline than british airway the fare look reasonable until you get to where you have to buy your seat plus if you have to cancel your flight in my case a meeting wa cancelled they won t issue a voucher or a refund i cancelled my flight six week in advance and they refunded of a ticket and they won t issue a voucher i will never fly british airway they are so greedy,positive
british airway first class seat are very good compared to their business class truly a great experience loving the window there s a cover that can open shade or close the pod are quite private configuration service very attentive and personal they will address you by name the moment you walk in escort you to your seat and supply welcome drink towel etc food is reasonable to good if you don t like part of the meal you can replace from part of other set turning it in fact into semi a la carte return flight wa over booked by phone and email they contacted me and with my permission i wa rebooked onto st class sq flight at same day at more or less the same time in all it wa a very pleasant experience the singapore lounge doe not have a st class section and is mixed with business class fare difference between business class and st class is not a huge a with some other airline definitely recommended,positive
london gatwick to cancun and i wa disappointed british airway economy class is incredibly standard in comparison to singapore airline or even virgin atlantic entertainment wa not particularly varied food wa shocking plus the staff were abrupt and snappy i do not fly often so sometimes i might ask question that seem pretty obvious but i shouldn t be shamed for that not flying with british airway again that s for sure,negative
i wa among the several hundred passenger whose british airway flight wa canceled last night from dallas ft worth to london no status indicating canceled wa put on the display at the gate once the decision wa made they were not updated people were told to call airway for help but were turned away by the phone system and a a result lost their place in line one woman had a glimmer of hope with the phone system only to be told that because she wa traveling with a baby she had to go back and wait in line only ticket counter were open to assist the passenger and each passenger took over minute to help on average one couple took approximately hour to be helped because they were booked to go on a cruise for their anniversary and this delay cost them their connection they were not able to get any arrangement that would get them to their cruise for another day the couple will now miss half their cruise no screening wa performed to get people with important connecting flight like that couple or myself close to the front of the line there were two other flight out to lhr that night that would have allowed me to still make my tour but due to the disorganization of the help i missed both even though one wa hour after the original cancellation it did not help that the british airway staff blatantly allowed people to cut in line for no reason i wa still in time to make the last flight out at pm but a couple wa allowed to cut in front of me in line and a a result by the time my new booking were made it wa too late people were falling out of line because there wa no area to rest or provision made for food or going to the restroom the customer were too exhausted to stand for that long no attempt to take a number and call people back wa made for the comfort of customer not even water wa passed out during the hour waiting period the counter staff and how they were managed wa completely inadequate the way british airway handled this cancellation wa atrocious thing break including airplane which is understood but the manner in which a company recovers from such debacle say a great deal about their character i am sorely disappointed in how this wa dealt with i will now miss the first and arguably most anticipated part of my tour to india and my traveling companion coming from atlanta will be there alone which is not safe for a young single female this airline ha cost me time money and most importantly safety for myself and my friend,positive
gothenburg to los angeles via london heathrow return with british airway everything went well and i especially like the upper deck of the a which feel spacious and relaxed the seat were comfortable for a hour flight i liked the bin at the window seat a this gave me opportunity to store more than i expected toilet were clean throughout the flight crew were excellent relaxed yet professional did not eat food so cannot comment on it drink and snack served on these flight i do miss the warm wet wipe that lufthansa for example hand out inflight entertainment better than usual i recommend the british airway a,positive

my mother s flight from london to moscow wa cancelled while understanding that these thing happen and accepting this inconvenience it is the customer service of british airway that i found outrageous first of all british airway would refuse to speak to me paying customer a they had incorrect data in the ticket purchase detail despite the fact that i had any proof they may need and all contact detail in the ticket purchase data were mine but fair enough there is more they couldn t speak to my mother she doesn t speak english they don t speak russian and while i wa trying to offer various option to customer service agent time passed by the time several hour later i suggested their moscow office call my mother to confirm her identity it wa too late moscow office wa closed and all wa offered is for my mother to call then next day needless to say she had to travel next day and it wa unacceptable option so at no point my mother wa offered anything required by regulation article and so ba appears to be in breach of those regulation i bought a ticket for my mother with aeroflot instead for a flight at a similar time to that cancelled by ba and asked ba for refund ba in turn and after my mother travelled to moscow demanded a letter of authority from her otherwise they would refuse to speak to me they would not for example call my mother in moscow and simply ask her my mother sent me letter of authority which i forwarded to the ba now they would speak to me and promised refund and compensation this wa on th september on th october day after regulation state that refund must be made within seven day i chased this with ba i wa promised a refund and compensation again a of today november nothing wa paid to me yet customer service responds with generic message themed we are sorry for the delay the refund will be with you soon my request are simply ignored so while it might be a reasonably comfortable airline when everything work well i would encourage everyone to very seriously consider how you will be treated in an event of a delay or cancellation in my experience the treatment wa appalling,negative

excellent flight and no complaint even though we were delayed due fog at gatwick the pilot kept u briefed a to what wa going on and the cabin crew looked after u i wa however dismayed by the ba agent that dealt with our check in at venice we were first in the queue when check in opened and a supervisor asked u to go this woman from the outset she wa not happy we were a party of and she only wanted to check in she wa difficult and surly throughout she told u we could not sit together and dotted u around the aircraft this would have been accepted had she not insisted that an infant in our party had to sit with a yr old boy and not with it mother we then asked the supervisor to intervene and guess what we were all seated together so it wa possible all the time by the time we had been checked in the whole of the rest of the plane had been checked in by the other staff this wa a dreadful agent representation of ba the uk s flag ship airline i feel ba need to know how their passenger are treated by agent staff i have not included this experience in my rating of ba once through check in the flight experience wa excellent,negative

i am a bronze member of the executive club british airway executive club is actually worthless since it is almost impossible to use their avios however one of the few benefit left is the option to choose your seat for free a week before the flight which i did unfortunately i found out when i tried to check in that i had been moved from the good seat i have chosen to the worst business class seat on this flight all my effort to get those seat back were in vain we flew the a for the first time i still strongly prefer the upper deck cabin beside the hd screen nothing can beat the quality of the old,negative
after flying with ba long haul for the first time on one of their newer a s the flight back to lhr wa with their b which is my favourite aircraft along with the a ground service at sfo wa efficient purchased extra luggage and wa still kg over my limit on each bag of which the check in agent wa considerate enough to let me off my guess wa that the flight wa not full a there wa virtually no one at the check in counter i wa wrong the gate wa packed considering i had piece of carry on luggage i wasn t asked to put one of them on the hold the flight wa delayed by approximately hour boarding wa smooth and efficient upon boarding passenger were having trouble storing their carry on resulting in me storing mine some row behind the seat is no surprise their older product with the outdated ife cabin temperature wa boiling passenger were requesting fa to turn it down a little which they have mid way through the flight when everyone wa asleep the seat pitch on the boeing is inch pitch in economy class compared to their a product the cabin felt cramped although the seat wa comfortable itself to sit on it just felt cramped i had the most uncomfortable long haul flight in my entire life the flight became more and more unbearable and wasn t able to get any sleep at all i wa constantly trying to find a comfortable position for me to have nap but it wa impossible and worse when the person in front of you reclines to make thing worse the ife wa very unreliable compared to the a i fly with ba frequently on european route where their economy cabin product is negligible due to the flight time but i would try and not fly with ba s product on their b s inflight meal were rather disappointing service wa rushed and fa s showed no enthusiasm first meal wa bland roast chicken landing meal wa an english breakfast considering we were arriving at lunch time overall i would fly with ba again but i would avoid the long haul product offered on their b s,negative
i flew with british airway for my family holiday to and from sharm el sheikh from london gatwick i checked in online both way hour before which wa fine and all went well however i have a special dietary need and i wa not able to click on this for the flight with ba you get meal snack and drink included so i knew that we would have a meal with a hour flight while on board i wa able to choose the fruit option for breakfast on the way there however on the way back it wa a cold deli option which consisted of a wrap a roll and some cracker i asked if there wa a gluten free option and the assistant said no just this following this we could have pretzel and biscuit with a drink obviously someone like me who is a coeliac cannot eat anything with wheat gluten so i wa left with a slab of cheese which should have gone with the cracker ba really need to address this a it is not fair to advertise they provide meal on board when clearly there wa nothing available for me luckily i always carry my own food with me and i did not starve also i didn t know why there wa no inflight entertainment for such a a long flight,positive

having flown with both va and ba i choose ba for my trip to from sfo on both leg the flight attendant seemed friendly and we were fed and watered at regular interval ife wa ok but the music option were poor hoping to fly with ba again to denver mid but only if they replace their old s on that route with something newer,positive
late friday night flight out of heathrow late takeoff due to traffic but flight wa smooth and landed right on schedule cabin staff were excellent extremely friendly and competent food service wa fast and with good quality would definitely recommend it for short haul flight although price wa much higher compared to other carrier,positive
heathrow gallery lounge overcrowded and under staffed table covered in used plate and glass which staff were not clearing many empty dish at the buffet unacceptably bad the dreamliner wa comfortable but disappointing in a new aircraft to find that there is still a lack of easy access storage space and shelf next to the seat a ever a pre loaded tray with ill fitting tablecloth plonked in front of you food service more a premium economy product than club no window blind but a gimmicky and slow system which dims the window and wa rather unsatisfactory overall a mediocre performance from ba which need to up it business class game particularly on new generation aircraft,negative
very comfortable flight in the club world cabin the amount of personal space is rather limited and it is frustrating having to climb over your prostrate neighbour s leg that said the club world seat are very comfortable when a upright b in z lounging position and c a flat bed in fact much more comfortable and sleep inducing than the much larger and spacious seat on the new singapore airline s which appear amazing but simply are not comfortable the big let down in ba club is the food plonked in front of you on a plastic try with a table cloth that doesn t fit then the condiment arrive in those ghastly sachet that look more at home in a transport cafe i like the seat despite the lack of personal and storage space but willie walsh is going too need to improve the food offer which fall well behind the asian and me carrier,positive
i purchased a club world return to narita in the black friday sale it cost which is a bargain for a direct business class return from heathrow to tokyo the lounge at heathrow wa not crowded and boarding wa prompt i had pre booked my seat rear facing by the window i wa sitting comfortably when a japanese gentleman arrived and told me i wa sitting in his seat i told him it wa my seat i asked to see his boarding pas which wa for my seat i showed him my electronic boarding pas which wa for the same seat at this stage the purser wa passing and we raised the issue i decided to stand my ground a i wa happy with my pre booked seat the purser went away to investigate when he returned he apologised for the error and quietly asked me to follow him and said i would not be disappointed i wa let to the front row of the first class seat and enjoyed an excellent flight to tokyo with splendid service and first class food and fine wine very spacious suite with comfortable seat and dedicated wardrobe an excellent flight,positive
checked in online prior to departure expecting to use a british airway online check in desk or fast bag drop on arrival at manchester airport ba used to have a fast bag drop desk for customer who have checked in online when i enquired a to where it wa on arrival at manchester airport i wa directed to the back of the long check in queue by a surly check in agent who stated we don t have one you have to join the back of the queue in that case what on earth is the benefit of checking in online it serf no purpose whatsoever the shuttle down to manchester wa delayed by about an hour a wa our onward flight from lhr to la this flight wa on one of their ancient b aircraft which wa year old and it showed the seat in economy were extremely uncomfortable for a hour flight and there wa no legroom inflight entertainment option were poor i have never undertaken such an uncomfortable flight the in flight catering wa mediocre but the cabin crew provided good service our return flight from la to lhr wa delayed by an hour and although we had booked to travel in and out from t at lhr i received an email half way through my trip informing me that we would be flying into t at lhr a we were already delayed into lhr by the time we had crossed to t our connecting flight to manchester had already departed and we had to be booked onto another flight which meant we had been travelling for a total of hour by the time we got home ba made sure our travel experience wa a miserable and inconvenient a possible i have decided after many issue of late with ba that i can no longer be bothered with the hassle if the flight are not delayed then they usually manage to lose my luggage i have finally had enough and will use other carrier whenever i can,negative
i recently got an unexpected upgrade to world traveller plus whilst on my way to new york there wa free cava before take off and a random hot towel handed out the seat wa roomy and leg room wa fantastic even more so because i wa at the front of the world traveller plus cabin just after club world so there were no seat in front of me inflight entertainment wa ok but not a good a i wa expecting i did struggle to find thing that interested me to watch a the choice wa quite limited i think now with early digital release of many film on thing like i tune the day of being able to see really recent film on aircraft before they become more widely available are coming to an end a i wa at the front of the cabin i had a screen that folded out of my armrest which meant i wa looking down at the screen instead of straight ahead which gave me a bit of a neck ache after awhile it wa also annoying to stow away the food wa good for airline food you get a superior meal in world traveller plus and it wa pretty tasty and filling the pre landing snack wasn t up to much though it wa a dull sandwich much like those that ba hand out on short haul european flight a real bonus about being in world traveller plus is that you re closer to the front of the plane and the exit this is useful when arriving in the u where immigration queue can sometimes be exceptionally long i ended up being close to the front of the immigration queue a i wa so quick off the plane which meant i wa out through immigration pretty quickly i think to pay for world traveller plus would be quite expensive for what you get in some respect essentially a nicer meal and more leg room but it wa a nice treat from ba and if you were going on a super long haul flight i can definitely see the attraction,positive
first ever long haul trip with british airway a i usually fly with cathay pacific or klm so i thought i d give ba a chance ground service at london heathrow terminal is smooth and no hassle check in and security wa very fast and efficient i particularly like ba s boarding procedure at heathrow very orderly and organised regardless of the fullness of the flight onboard the a is ba s new world traveller cabin on the main deck at x x configuration ba offer inch legroom compared to cx s inch and it wa surprisingly very comfortable with the slim design seat ife had a few glitch but the fa s were happy to assist and worked perfectly throughout the flight however more movie tv programme and music option could be offered meal were mediocre drink were served around an hour after take off meal followed straight after lunch meal option wa either curry vegetarian pasta or chicken and often for the latter surprisingly good but still not a good a cx portion could be better drink were offered throughout the flight along with snack box pre landing meal wa also given with two option pasta or chicken casserole i went for the latter again portion could be better overall i would fly long haul with ba again on their new product a b er and b,positive
a superb flight and a very high standard of service the dreamliner aircraft wa very clean the seat were perfectly comfortable the staff were smart and professional at all time the steward offered to hang my jacket and we were offered drink and snack throughout the flight the quality of the indian tamil food wa second to none and authentic the captain gave clear and friendly announcement overall i felt proud to fly british airway to india to me the airline is a cut above the rest,positive
lhr to venice wa on time friendly cheerful crew and a very enjoyable plate of cold cut cheese warm roll and fruit for breakfast way better than any other breakfast i ve had on a ba flight long or short haul seat comfortable very enjoyable flight the return leg barcelona to lhr had the same meal so wa very happy plus a glass of wine a it wa lunchtime the standby crew member who happened to be a purser in business class wa chatty friendly and pleasant to everyone he did his best to make up for his colleague major shortcoming the original designated purser for the flight on the other hand wa well he plonked the meal down in front of you without uttering one word the only word he spoke to the entire passenger in the club section were do you want it or not he put the roll basket in front of everyone s nose but still did not utter one word it wa bizarre i ve never on any airline experienced such rudeness and disdain for passenger whatever class they were flying he couldn t even be polite to his colleague with just a pas me some coke and that wa that overall we had a very good flying experience with ba but i wont forget that purser and his attitude for a long time,positive
san francisco to edinburgh via london with british airway upon arrival at edinburgh airport we waited over an hour before we were informed only after seeking out the information ourselves a opposed to an announcement of any kind being made that our luggage wa lost at heathrow along with other bag thing happen and can be forgiven it s what happened after the fact that is so completely appalling we were not given any voucher or helped in any way by the baggage claim people or by the customer service desk we were told that our bag would be delivered to u in hour since we going to be in a different place every night a we traveled through scotland we gave them the address of the b b where we would be the following night essentially giving them more than the hour to get our bag to u we received a text saying that the bag were out for delivery they did not arrive in the next seven day i spent an average of hour a day on the phone with the call center in india who were absolutely no help at all the customer service phone line at ba wa not being answered and the supposed courier service phone line of them were gone out of service a well i emailed both the courier service and ba customer service and did not receive a response from either one still the courier website listed our luggage a being out for delivery on the evening of the fifth day it took minute to get a supervisor on the line in india who took another hour to tell me that the baggage claim area in edinburgh wa closed and there wa nothing she could do the bag were continually listed a being out for delivery but they never showed up we were never contacted and neither wa the b b where we had had them supposedly sent on the morning of the sixth day on yet another call to india i stated that the extra medicine my friend had brought with her on the plane had run out and that i wa going to have to consider taking her to the hospital then in a few hour we received a call from a nice chap at the edinburgh baggage claim who said he had both bag right there that they had never been out for delivery at all we would be in tarbert on harris the next night and he had them flown out to u seven day after our arrival in edinburgh during the seven day we had to purchase clothes to wear we missed doing some of the thing we had planned to do because of the time spent on the phone with ba and the time spent shopping for clothes when we made the return flight we had to pay for an extra checked bag to accommodate the clothing we had purchased finally a month later we have received a note of intended compensation from british airway for the amount of the clothing only not anything for the extra bag that we checked that contained clothes that we shouldn t have needed to buy or to check through and only needed to do so due to the incompetence of british airway that s completely on them and we should be reimbursed for the charge one would think that there would be some offer of a voucher towards future travel if not monetary compensation for time and inconvenience but nothing wa offered,negative
the is definitely showing it s age nonetheless it wa comfortable pre take off drink offered included water oj or sparkling wine ba also give the option of pre ordering your choice of main course online so although i did notice they ran out of choice towards the end of the service i had received my beef i advise anyone in first business world traveller plus to use this facility world traveller plus is definitely an enhanced economy versus some airline premium economy which is more a business minus so keep expectation in check you get a bigger seat pre take off drink little amenity kit and a slightly upgraded meal however considering that i paid only per sector on top of the usual world traveller economy fare it wa worth every penny in my eye would i pay a crazy supplement for this class of travel no but if the surcharge is minimal i d highly recommend it,positive
my daughter wa booked on a flight from antigua to st kitts on september flight ba the flight left nearly minute early stranding passenger who had just managed to get through custom i have no idea how a flight can leave early or how you can leave without passenger the attendant at the desk merely informed these passenger that the desk wa closed and they should return tomorrow it wa on a saturday afternoon nothing wa offered to help these passenger get to their final destination after calling multiple time and sending various email i wa granted a refund my full refund offer came with a cancellation fee and a service fee i have yet to accept the offer we never cancelled her flight nor received anything that look like service do not fly this airline they are inept and have no idea what customer service is there is no value for money when the flight departs early,positive

my wife and i who are and respectively arrived at terminal in jan to travel to johannesburg this wa our first experience of the size of this terminal and assumed that this wa where we were to eventualy board our flight however after sitting around for many hour it occured to u that we had picked up any information regarding the flight so we went to the ba desk only to be informed that the flight had left and that we had been waiting in the wrong part of terminal five and if we had been in the right area we would have heard them paging u whilst i take full resposibilty not checking the flight board properly i would like to complain about the way we were treated from that point on it wa now pm on a cold jan night my wife and i were escorted to the exit and left to find shelter for the night in an area that we were totally lost in until we returned for a different flight the next day,negative

endured horrible british airway return flight from heathrow to cape town the plane seems to be from the s somehow the seat are really narrow so that anyone with remotely broad shoulder spill over onto the seat next to them i couldn t fit between a larger man one one side and a woman on the other and resorted to leaning forward for much of the flight thankfully a child wa on one side on the way back there were a number of flyer on the plane who had clearly done the route before a many refused to sit togther forcing first time flyer on the route like me to be squashed between them the seat were also incredibly uncomfortable the moulding on the back wa took narrow and dug into my bag i only fell asleep through sheer exhaustion but woke up repeatedly with back pain from the seat other passenger walked around the cabin throughout the flight while some resorted to sitting in the flight attendant seat also the seat in front of the toilet don t fully recline the tv control are fixed into the arm rest which make them uncomfortable to put your arm on and you inevitably press one of the button accidentally the tv themselves are about year old small and poor quality the selection of movie wa not great it wa very hot onboard the plane and passenger repeatedly asked for the air conditioning to be turned up the service wa good on the way out but the return flight service wa poor the staff appeared disinterested one flight attendant responded rudely to me when i asked if i could use the overhead locker above my seat that had her bag in it another told the child next to me when he asked for sprite with his dinner they had run out even though i saw a flight attendant drinking a can of sprite minute later generally they seemed more interested in rushing through the service and stuffing their mouth than helping anyone my call button wa ignored twice another passenger pressed their s and the attendant simply came and turned it off then walked away she said she d be back in a moment but didn t return the food wa generally ok,negative
british airway still trade on the you are lucky to be flying with u mentality am on a friday morning at the flagship terminal at home base and there are just business class check in desk open so queued for nearly minute just to drop a bag south gallery lounge more like a refugee centre than a premier cabin lounge people sleeping across sofa and chair full to almost standing room only but managed to perch on the arm of a sofa before giving it up a a waste of time boarding very low key quick and easy excellent crew and very surprised by the level and quality of catering and looked after well it s the hardware that s so far below par business class seating is across that s like a lot of economy cabin a window seat felt very cramped and claustrophobic the cabin wall curved inwards and the seat is directly underneath where the hand luggage bin sit so it s quite an exercise to extricate yourself no wifi and although there s a video on demand system it s the same fuzzy focus bleached colour quality that i remember from when i first started flying with ba decade ago,positive
recently there have been more delay and this particular british airway trip wa worse still i wa originally booked to fly from london city to geneva first thing in the morning but the flight got cancelled i did not receive so much a an email from ba about this the only way i found it wa cancelled wa by going into my original confirmation email a the flight did not even register on the british airway app my replacement flight wa from heathrow so i had to make my way all the way across london at my own expense to get that flight which then ended up being delayed by hour british airway for some year ha been a great airline but i fear crack are starting to appear,negative

don t ever fly with british airway we went cancun for our honeymoon and on the way there they seated my husband at the opposite end of the plane only hour of being married when we arrived in cancun our bag didn t make it there so we had to wait day for our bag and go out and buy some clothes travelling back they lost them again so not only did they lose our bag once but twice and had to wait day again for them i advise anyone reading this to not waste your money,positive
crew were excellent friendly and efficient seat adequate for premium economy service plenty of legroom and good recline entertainment good food wa good if you could get the meal you preferred suggest person allocating the choice research better into preference a we struggled to get first choice on all sector seated in last row of premium economy criticism would be that british airway charge extra for you to select seat prior to ensure you are sitting next to your companion and there is no priority check in or boarding luggage toilet are in economy cabin and could be lengthy wait whilst other airline provide dedicated toilet for premium economy however the fare for syd lhr return pretty good value,positive
do not waste your money quite simply british airway premium economy from london to bangkok return wa pathetic economy class food is served plastic not glass for drink the seat are marginally wider than economy class but i could not eat my food without lifting the plate from my tray to my mouth i bought a bottle of scotch on return to heathrow and then transferred to manchester flight the bottle wa confiscated by security because it wa not sealed by staff onboard i called ba customer service who said it wa my fault because i should have told the purser i wa going on to manchester staff were generally good but never again on british airway,positive
booked a british airway trip from sydney to london via singapore through travel agent not knowing the business class seating plan big mistake on my part seat plan is we were allocated seat e and f the middle seat in the block of so wa flying backwards seat are too cramped compared to other airline no storage space apart from a small draw to store a laptop a plastic privacy screen is all that separated me from the person in the aisle seat and that had to be lowered and raised when cabin crew served meal and drink when the aisle seat wa made into flat bed i had to climb over person to use bathroom etc this could be a problem for less mobile passenger you should not expect to have to do this with the cost of flying business class the cabin crew provided good service and food wa okay this is the first and last time i will be using british airway to fly business class unless they change the seating configuration for business class,negative
we had flown london to johannesburg return with british airway in may and were underwhelmed this time wa a huge improvement pleasant efficient staff glass of fizzy to welcome u whch is better than orange juice the food wa good especially the steak which wa also good on the return flight nice wine served by cheerful cabin crew brandy after meal brought without hesitation water brought during night the a is staggeringly quiet with good av system very comfy i have a short body and long leg wailing child all night,positive
there are so many poor review here for british airway and i am just about to add another one the return trip started in the shared lounge at pisa it comfortable enough but forget it if you are hungry there is no food to snack on just a few bag of crisp nut and sealed croissant booze choice is okay quite why in italy of all place a platter of mixed meat cheese and typical antipasti cannot be provided probably costing about a day is a mystery british airway don t care no airbridge so a trudge to the plane it wa an ex bmi a and given they ceased trading three year ago one would think that the internal software could be changed to show british airway branding and not bmi very strange old ba club europe tired seat fa were fine food mediocre funny thing wa the cabin smelt of a rather tasty meaty sort of meal a we took off i wa starving and full of optimism all we got wa a miserable afternoon tea dried sandwich scone and jam i compensated my gloom with a few gin and tonic i asked myself is this worth it the extra for the product what you get i suppose is a toilet for passenger compared with two toilet between or so wider seat no extra legroom a meal over economy but not by much glass to drink from rather than plastic beaker and a faster exit from the plane a few extra avios point that s it basically not a lot anyway we left minute early and arrived minute ahead of schedule nice smooth flight but i could have had that on ryanair british airway really don t care a the many review on here clearly show,positive
london to sydney via singapore in business class i am english born and have always had an affinity with british airway i had not flown with them for a while and booked business class seat for my wife and i and have to say how underwhelmed we were with the whole experience and will not be trying them again they are so far behind other airline you expect in business class to feel just a bit special but a reviewed earlier you do not get any special service a lousy check in herded along with the rest on boarding a lousy inflight toiletry bag a for the food just awful on both leg to sydney the crew on the london to singapore were unengaging at least the nd leg crew were better the bad news is that i still have the return leg to lhr with them,negative
british airway from antigua to gatwick a shabby aircraft my seat wa broken it would recline without command the head rest wa broken and the seat cover were very worn the inflight entertainment had to be re set a it wasn t working and when it did work my screen did not display the safety briefing image would freeze in effect i did not receive the briefing the cabin staff refused to dispose of my wife s drink because it wa not finished i had to request another hostess to take it the food wa poor quality in general too looked like a kid meal pasta with cheese check in wa good queue were long but the staff were very helpful and the flight left on time british airway is not in the league of other long haul carrier like emirate a lot of work to be done to refresh it s image,positive

london heathrow to singapore and the business class of british airway is below the standard set by it competitor at heathrow terminal there is no special check in counter for business class passenger after performing the self check in we have to join a common queue to drop our check in bag i spent min in the queue the business class seat is narrower than other airline there is also a lack of storage space for small item such a glass it is relatively comfortable to sit and sleep on but business class travel is about a total experience and british airway ha a lot of catching up to do,positive
in the last couple of year british airway ha been refurbishing aircraft nad ha minimized the leg space to ridiculous level this not only for economy but also in business class it is unfair to ask a business class passenger to sit so uncomfortably when they pay double the price of economy in addition they have this policy for bag but one going under the seat in front of the passenger this applies even to business class,negative
san diego to heathrow check in security and boarding were all with minimum delay cabin crew efficient and friendly food quality wasn t great nothing like food served a few year ago and their amenity bag really isn t worth having having said that we had a pleasant flight a crew made up for disappointing food we even managed several hour sleep which is always a bonus,positive
having originally booked in to fly economy it wa a nice surprise to see we had been upgraded to premium economy the seat were large and reclined quite a lot the food wa delicious entertainment wa the same and offered a good standard of film and tv series however having seen the little difference between economy and premium economy we don t think we would be prepared to pay the difference,positive
we flew british airway world traveller plus premium economy on the flight from vancouver to london the male steward responsible for our section of the aircraft wa indifferent to passenger during the night section of the flight he spilt a drink over my wife made no attempt to clean up the resulting spill and when he returned to our area he casually commented did i spill something on you my wife replied yes you did and i hope it wa water no he replied it wa juice and walked away the inflight entertainment wa limited and subject to repeatedly breaking down the food wa indifferent and the snack we received before landing at heathrow consisted of a dry croissant no butter some jam and a half a cup of tea i have not travelled with british airway for a number of year due to previous bad experience where the passenger is made to feel like an inconvenience i hoped they would have learnt and improved this certainly wa not the case on this flight,positive
booked through iberia a year before departure with the addition of a connection to la palmas online check in completed hour in advance which is when i noticed that yet again ba had subbed the boeing on this service to an a the leg room in this departure from lhr wa good with the new seating offering a more comfortable ride than iberia express food wa a cold breakfast croissant which wasn t too bad once it had come up to cabin temperature cabin crew weren t the friendliest bunch if you have a connection at madrid barajas airport leave at least two hour the place is huge with very confusing signpost and for some reason if you connect t s to a t departure you have to go through security but if you do a t to t s connection there s no additional security,positive
british airway is clearly cost cutting now and i wonder whether they just want to sell off their shorthaul operation the a to and from bologna had new seating which wa one of the smallest and most uncomfortable seat i have experienced the crew were ok but looked bored indifferent and just really could not be bothered with passenger then came the complimentary food and drink which included half a cup of luke warm tea hat off to british airway for pushing passenger towards low cost carrier,positive
just arrived back in uk on british airway after a stay in la vega on outbound flight the chicken dinner ran out at the next row to me alternative wa spinach pasta i declined on return journey earlier today the breakfast consisting of bacon and sausage ran out one row from u had to endure veggie option of hash brown tomato mushroom for some reason they serve from front and rear and by the time they meet around the low row you don t get a choice surely in the day of computer checking everything they would know the ratio of meal that passenger are choosing tv screen did not work for entire flight steward even advised london were re setting it remotely from ground,positive
trip got off to a disappointing start with the british airway lounge crammed to the rafter we struggled to find a seat breakfast choice wa okay nothing exciting the second lounge below floor ha long been closed and show no sign of re opening classic ba thinking regular flyer wont notice but we do the furniture seat etc are long overdue for replacement all very tatty the plane wa quite new clean but had the old club europe seat which is neither here or there we were in a and c and had decent leg room took off minute late due to delay at pisa and some runway modification or so we were told inflight service wa strange food first then the drink the brunch wa a nice salad and some fruit the two crew member looked and sounded bored one i don t think knew how to smile then we got stacked over the mediterranean for twenty minute due to runway modification we landed unusually from the east and i have to say it wa a rather spectacular u turn landing which a an aviation enthusiast i rather enjoyed we were parked on the tarmac like a ryanair flight we used to have an airbridge when flying british airway which justified in part the higher cost now we don t another obvious cost cutting exercise by the accountant at british airway hq bag delivered within minute which given we were one of plane on the ground wa to be expected,positive

this british airway trip wa one of the worst experience i have had the business class seating wa terrible requiring literally stepping over and sometimes on my fellow passenger additionally i wa facing backwards while flying the service wa poor food barely edible the lounge lacking in nearly every way from dirty table torn furniture and lack of power outlet i suggest doing everything you can to avoid this airline their competitor exceed them,negative

flew british airway from toronto to rome via london and have no complaint with our flight or crew which were excellent but when we arrived in rome my opinion of british airway wa formed none of the passenger baggage arrived in rome and we were all left in the dark when no baggage came down we all got into the baggage handler lineup avia and wasted time filling out a form we were given a phone number for british airway but it wa out of service call to avia went unanswered we finally went outto the airport day later and found our baggage in an unsecured location we werd never informed by british airway if and when we would receive our baggage we did receive compensation for the clothing and toiletry we had to buy but not fod the expense of getting out to the airport this ha soured our opinion of british airway,negative

we paid for world traveller plus premium economy for our british airway flight to london aircraft wa a boeing excellent plane cabin crew very efficient and friendly seat and legroom very good what i find lacking to make world traveller plus worth the money is no priority check in or security no priority boarding for wtp passenger in fact wtp passenger were the very last to board even united delta and american offer priority check in and boarding i contacted british airway to inquire why and the reply wa the usual corporate speak we re very sorry you were disappointed blah blah blah okay british airway you could care less,positive
my issue is the very poor british airway customer relation service you receive once there is an issue it is only then you see what ba really is following a dreadful experience trying to sort out a weekend in paris i decided to complain to british airway customer relation that wa the start of a nightmare and frustrating experience ba customer service is like the fawlty tower of customer service i have tried many time ringing longest on hold before i hung up wa hr fastest through min they only want to get you off the phone a quick a they can and keep apologising that they are so busy i have emailed them and had generic email back no resolution worst is they are from different people who clearly have not read the note from previous email i have had two phone call following tweet all they tried to do wa sell me something and had no idea that i wa trying to complain they said they would get customer service to call me but guess what no call,negative

the a is a splendid aircraft with a great passenger experience i chose to fly mel lhr via hkg so i could try british airway new a i wa so disappointed to see that they have used the old backwards forward layout for club world on this new aircraft type i remember using this seat type back in but it is now tired and lacklustre when compared to other airline a brand new plane and tired old seat design it felt a though we were being packed in so that british airway can max out the revenue the whole thing wa a bit claustrophobic the service wa okay but not outstanding the food wa good and the wine choice excellent ground crew in hkg were pretty average but in london were helpful,positive
british airway is an airline with a very mixed quality i am flying it very often and i think that quality is decreasing over the last few month whereas lounge are great and the staff is almost nice the flight attendant sometimes are unfriendly on this flight one flight attendant hit me twice with his cabin trolley and did not even excuse himself the aircraft and the seat in premium economy are quite good including food and drink but the worst with ba is customer support and help with problem on my outbound flight from phl to lhr i had a problem with reserving a seat although it wa shown a free in the map no bassinet i wa not able to select it first time calling the customer support i wa told this is a technical error second time the lady told me that this is not bookable a this is next to a bassinet then one day later is wa reserved i called again and they told me that i wa too late any hint on my two other call wa answered with that s your problem you have a seat what is the problem i mean at least she is right but the attitude is extremely bad and maybe there is a reason why i want to have this seat my email with a complaint on this wasn t answered till today excet for the automated we will answer asap if british airway continue with that customer service i might change shortly,negative

british airway from heathrow to manchester ok it s only a min flight but about a one hour delay with no explanation before take off and no apology from the flight deck i booked a seat near the front and wa moved to the very back row because of a change of aircraft there i could hear every word of conversation from the young cabin crew in the galley and not all thing the passenger should be hearing torn uniform on female attendant brusque drink service from male steward who gave the impression that the job is a bit beneath him waiting age for the plane to empty so i could get off crew not helping anyone and no eye contact for the dismal goodbye on getting off,negative
first and last time travelling with british airway the flight outw wa reasonable although they are sadly lacking in comparison to other airline my first question is doe anybody from british airway actually read these comment if they do how can they go on providing a service that is so bad we arrived in toronto on th september to be told our luggage had been left at heathrow along with other bag they were well prepared at toronto to deal with u having been forwarned of the problem after filling in the relevant form we were informed that our bag would be with u in hour nut it wa day later when we were finally reunited with them british airway should investiage the company they use in toronto a they were extremely rude when we telephone to enquire when they thought the bag would be delivered even hanging up on the hotel manager who tried to help u only after my husband asked where they were and said he would collect the bag himself did we get an answer and then it took until p m on the friday to be delivered the final straw wa having paid extra for two seat together by the window on the return journey we found out upon checking in that we could not have these seat and we had to sit in a row of not a problem normally but it had cost extra to book these seat and not one of the staff wa interested just a take or leave it attitude,negative

i m not one for publishing review but following discussion of flight problem have just heard of skytrax i have lost track of the number of flight i ve taken over the year on business in europe and on holiday worldwide with family in the u regular flight have almost exclusively till now been with british airway some economy some wtp more recently in business service value etc ha to now ranged from acceptable to good occasionally excellent shame thing seem to have changed for our annual trip last december i booked my year old daughter and myself on british airway lhr to chicago returning from washington dulles to lhr both flight in business class booking process online reasonably good with helpful assistance from a real person when there wa a problem which happened time in the month before departure no common sense used when flight are cancelled and suitable alternative booked when seat had been pre purchased when clearly travelling with a child check in and departure were smooth travel in economy mean that they feed child first travel in business and they serve child serve after the adult the child meal when it eventually arrived wa a disgrace i wouldn t feed it to an animal pea blackened mash dried and crusty not surprisingly she didn t want it ended up eating my meal entertainment screen essential for child and part of the treat of the journey didn t work so we swopped seat so no entertainment screen for mummy thank goodness i had my kindle no apology from staff more interested in the male business traveller return flight after christmas from washington dulles to lhr wa slightly better evening meal available in lounge prior to boarding providing you re an adult again nothing for child except some biscuit if i m willing to pay british airway business class fare for myself and my daughter i expect better service than this very disappointed will i fly ba again yes but grudgingly and once the airmiles are used up who know,positive
nairobi to london with british airway the service wa good except that they gave given up on collecting jacket seat is getting tired bit coming off disgraceful level of cleanliness between the seat and the side of the cabin wa a very old accumulation of fluff mouldy peanut crumb an old sandwich wrapper and a mini mar bar very old felt sick given this wa highlighted in the press recently it must be that british airway really doe not care,negative

i recently travelled british airway from phoenix to london heathrow this is my rd time i have flown this route onboard one of the boeing and i must say british airway have got to either fully upgrade their b fleet or retire the aircraft the seat are far too cramped and not comfortable the in flight entertainment had to be rebooted several time a they stopped working or didn t work at all the heat in the cabin wa unbearable at time and very uncomfortable the only plus point were crew who were very attentiveand willing to help and the food wasn t too bad i am aware that around boeing s are getting refitted but by the look of it unfortunately the b on the phoenix route is not and for me a the route i travel cause me concern and ha me wondering if i will travel with ba again not everyone can afford to fly business or first but that doesn t mean that we give up on the right to have a little space to move seat that don t feel like they are going to cripple you have an entertainment system that work and ha a better selection of movie tv show music other airline such a emirate have a fabulous system even in economy so why can t british airway use the same type of technology if ba want to compete please do something about it,positive
check in for my british airway flight at gatwics north terminal with no queue and staff friendly and chatty boarding wa quick the a had not yet been fitted with the new seat but they were still comfortable and moderately spacious the cabin crew were friendly and attentive the return journey wa also quite good except the flight wa change to a departure instead of so it meant that nearly most shop except duty free at alicante were closed also it meant that the flight arrived back into gatwick at which wasn t very pleasant a we had to then drive another hour and a half home british airway gatwick operation is quite good and punctual not like heathrow,positive
these british airway flight were undoubtedly the worst we ve ever had to south africa in ten year of travelling there the seat were narrow lumpy and incredibly uncomfortable especially for a long haul journey i thought initially that we were unlucky and got broken or faulty seat on our outward journey but they were just a bad on the return journey to add insult to injury we d selected and paid for seat of our preference but when we got to the airport for our return journey we were told the seat were gone and simply told we would have to apply for a refund the worst aspect of the flight however wa the heat the aircraft wa oppressively hot and stuffy for hour on the way from johannesburg to london many passenger complained but the crew could apparently do nothing because the air conditioning system appeared too old to regulate the temperature also the entertainment system had to be switched off and rebooted several time because many passenger console were not working there were passenger who had to do without entertainment for the entire hour flight these aircraft are not fit for flying and should have been retired a decade ago pity the poor crew who have to work on these clapped out aircraft every day we ve been travelling to south africa several time a year for the past decade and this wa our first time travelling with british airway clearly it will also be our last avoid british airway or their boeing s at all cost,negative
vienna to london heathrow return in september both flight in economy on an a crew pleasant but not doing more than absolutely required a snack and drink were served on both leg this time the sandwich consisted of a mini pastrami and cheese sandwich and a mini black currant bun edible but not ba s best sandwich offering additional drink were served on request both leg featured the new slim seat in the cabin with reduced legroom while the seat are slightly better than the recaro slim seat i miss the older more comfortable seat with better leg room i did not really realize that ba ha changed the rule recently and travelling only with hand baggage now also mean that one is no longer allowed to pick a seat during check in but a seat is randomly allocated selecting any seat even a middle seat in the back of plane now cost eur also if one later decides to check a piece of luggage the cost are a whopping eur at the airport or eur on line the final fare with ba can be substantially higher than the initial price quote the additional charge are displayed during the booking process and if one commits to checking luggage during the booking process the charge are lower with the exception of a free drink and sandwich british airway economy product is now pretty much a low cost airline product being oneworld sapphire doe not help either no privilege here still the same charge for seat selection and checking luggage while vie lhr wa on time the return lhr vie leg wa delayed for one hour after a timely boarding the full plane wa waiting for the departure but then the flight deck announced that they are waiting for some cargo to be loaded and they missed their assigned slot which meant waiting an hour for a new slot so basically ba inconvenienced a whole plane of passenger to load some delayed cargo flying with hand baggage only i used web check in for both flight which worked fine boarding procedure were unremarkable and pleasant ba us a shared lounge in vie the lounge a such is acceptable small and mostly packed but far from great with limited and lower quality offering the selection seems to be more or less the same in all lounge in vie ba gallery lounge in lhr t a comfortable oasis amid a busy airport and food and drink selection wa better than vie wine selection wa nice ba still us t for it flight to vie which i consider a huge benefit over using t which tends to be a mess for passenger while i stopped flying british airway business in europe they ba changed business seating to economy seat with no additional legroom i see no valid reason to pay any surcharge for this product but i still consider ba one of the better option for economy flight in europe however their new low cost airline concept also mean that the time when i wa willing to pay higher price just for flying with ba over easyjet or austrian on this route are unfortunately over,positive
the british airway seat were extremely small uncomfortable and did not operate properly in order to recline the seat or return it to the upright position you had to do it manually the bathroom throughout the plane were dirty and smelly from the minute we boarded the meal british airway served were abysmal on the way home from london to the u s passenger had the choice of a chicken curry dish with saffron rice or the vegetarian option the smell of curry make me nauseated so i opted for the vegetarian dish i wa served greasy overly seasoned pasta soaked in oil and covered with a soggy bread crumb topping it wa inedible my partner received the chicken curry dish which wa small fatty piece of chicken overly seasoned and soaked oil the dish served are poorly chosen for the general population of people who fly british airway the food should be clean fresh food not covered in grease and oil and not overly seasoned the portion are too small and the dessert item chosen are also odd and not appealing to people it appears british airway will serve just about anything so they can keep the food price down and the profit up,negative
denver to london with british airway we were allocated rubbish seat near the toilet the seat would recline but would creep forward during the night which bent the jack in my headphone lately we ve found the aircraft are tired and in much need of an update poor quality screen very small seat not much bigger than a short haul flight find the air hostess steward are often quite bored and provide a no thrill service there s not much wrong with them per se but a smile would go a long way we now specifically look for other airline to fly with a we ve had enough of british airway for long haul flight,negative
heathrow to munich return with british airway i have never published a negative review of anything ever before i work in the service industry and have several friend who are cabin crew i am not a demanding passenger i rarely request anything unless invited to do so and i rarely request anything other than water however my first experience of british airway business class wa let down by crew serving me the female cabin attendant on my return flight could not have been nicer but the male attendant on my flight out wa noticeably dismissive of me a a female passenger to the men sitting near me he wa chatty and offering them extra drink etc i wa made to feel like a huge inconvenience such a shame and it ha made me reconsider whether the extra cost is worthwhile,positive

a very pleasant experience apart from the so called fast track lane that took minute the business class lounge wa very nice with a great choice of drink and snack for early morning departure a a regular on the gatwick to sharm el sheikh route it wa a breath of fresh air to have the option of a full service airline and oneworld member the business class seat are the same a economy class on the a but the middle seat blocked off worked for me and the fare paid wa very similar to easyjet flexi rate excellent service from take off to landing,positive
sharm el sheikh to gatwick i checked in at british airway business class counter and the agent wa unprofessional and unwelcoming all my question involved him having to ask a colleague in the adjacent economy class check in i asked staff where the lounge access wa located and wa abruptly told there wa no lounge access despite ba stating on their website that business class passenger have access to the royal jordanian lounge which i saw no sign of so i had to use the general and expensive ssh airport facility boarding wa absolute mayhem with no separate call for business class or oneworld member to board first so i jumped on the bus to be called off and told the check in agent had booked me in economy class row d which wa listed a business class at on line check in after a wait of minute a new boarding bass wa issued for seat c and the aircraft bus had to be called back to pick me up onboard thing did improve and chatted with friendly crew however the pre boarding did not represent a premium product,negative
first time to experince british airway new shorthaul cabin on a flight from heathrow to gibraltar and we were pleasantly surprised i am and found the leg room in the aisle seat to be fine the seat wa generally comfortable though lumbar would be nice brown leather look good and new lighting calming overall very good i did look at the business class seat which are basically the same a economy so will probably not fly business with ba shorthaul again but will stay with economy the staff were very professional and pleasant you may however want to take your own packed lunch a the morsel given are not good,positive
british airway boeing wa a bit long in the tooth with old style club world seat old video system audio jack loose and needed constant fiddling to keep sound coming through both ear the isolation of the window seat in ba club world is a double edged sword privacy is great but cabin crew tend to forget you on this flight i did not receive a hot towel or an offer of a second drink though everyone else around me did all said and done the flight wa on time food and wine were good and i wa pretty comfortable,positive
early morning flight from stockholm to heathrow on sep th sat in the first row which had a little bit more legroom but compared with the older club europe seat not very comfortable the purser seemed to have had a relly bad night sleep in stockholm being really rude and unfriendly to customer but laughing loudly with his fellow fa s he kept on slamming the door in the galley loudly throughout the flight my friend who flew business class for first time wa shocked fortunately our late evening return flight wa a totally different story with an extremely attentive male purser who wa there all the flight,negative
london to seattle with british airway and i wa very disappointed when dinner wa being served and to my surprise they did not have my vegetarian meal onboard but somehow they gave to others although i requested my special meal when i booked my flight return at least month earlier a well a checking in online in the end i sat while everyone else ate around me this wa a long flight couldn t sleep and remained hungry so i didn t enjoy the experience,positive
i had not flown british airway business class for year sydney to singapore wa a reward flight and i probably wouldn t pay a much a other airline for this product but if it wa cheaper than competitor i would pick it seat a bit narrow but otherwise acceptable and i like the fact you can slide the table away and get out easily service wa top notch and very surprised had an excellent stewardess in our area meal service with two salad and some nice bread along with a decent main small snack before landing i always feel that a bigger option should be provided on a hour flight since it is too small for you not to have to eat again when you arrive ife had a good selection and worked fine i like the way they have set out the club world cabin it is a bit different and although crowded it is calm and professional obviously the seat do not compare to the best out there if they were materially cheaper than say singapore airline or emirate then i would take it if they want to charge a similar price then obviously the product is not the same quality,positive
tokyo haneda to heathrow in club world with british airway my trip wa on an old boeing and apart from the old product i could not believe the dirt and wear in this cabin crumb and mess around the bottom and edge of the seat grubby mark that i presume even the japanese cleaner could not remove the toilet i used remained dirty throughout the flight the meal service ha been much debated and is served rather pushed at you on a cheap economy style format and quality is on a par with jal economy class i used in august i m british and like to support ba but the honest fact is that ba have slipped right down against from the competition my journey out wa from frankfurt on lufthansa an airline i probably wouldn t have used a few year ago but their business class standard are so much higher ba cabin staff should go to lufthansa for some training and maybe they could lose some of their arrogant approach,negative
a hour delay but notified by text earlier in the day so no waiting around the problem is that british airway business class club world product and service is so old and tired that it is just very poor value and quality the inflight entertainment is constantly faulty and breaking they had to keep resetting it this ha happened on the last two ba club flight i have been on the seat are tired it wa not very clean the locker by the window on the upper deck were dirty and falling apart the food wa quite good except the dessert wa awful they always seem to serve the same lemon dessert on this leg the crew were pleasant but the plane are too old and tired now to make this an attractive option i look to avoid british airway when i can for business class,negative
barcelona to london heathrow and late again british airway really need to sort out their schedule i can always guarantee a late out of foreign terminal but early or on time when flying outbound lateness is normally due to baggage or missing person or someone who ha not turned up to travel the food service is still complimentary thank goodness you get a twin pack of a roll and currant bun on the barcelona route better than a huge panini they used to serve drink service is extremely limited a always one serving only of tea coffee for the price using a schedule service into london heathrow and complimentary light snack for just wa a bargain,positive
my son and his fiance travelled to st kitts to get married they spent ten day on their wedding moon when it wa time to return they were unable to check in online the website offered a phone number to call and there wa no answer they tried for three hour they finally called me in the uk and i called british airway i wa told that because i did not buy the ticket with my credit card they couldn t help me i wa given another number to call the second person i spoke to managed to resolve the problem that wa preventing online check in which meant that it wa then possible however so much time had passed sorting this mess out that by the time we got into the system most of the seat were allocated and my son and his new bride could not sit next to one another for this long haul flight when they tried to upgrade they were told it would be u each british airway could not care less,negative
maybe i ve just flown u carrier too much but i think british airway is a cut above them a it ha been in the last few year they take care of you during the flight multiple drink service with alcoholic beverage included and water and orange juice through the flight hot meal service to begin with a better than average beef offering and then a sandwich tea etc before landing i am part of their frequent flyer program and wa given a different seat from the one i had selected the seat just behind the bulkhead ordinarily i don t like those seat a there s nowhere to put your thing when the plane take off but i wa in the middle and the three seat between me and the man in the other aisle seat in my row were empty presumably this is why i wa moved to this seat a it wa better so i just used the seat beside me and it worked out fine seat wa wider than u economy with more leg room and a leg rest that came out from below so quite comfortable i can t ever say i enjoy a hour flight but flying with british airway make it more bearable,positive
having previously flown with british airway a few year ago i wa quite disappointed the legroom wa a expected and i had no complaint about that but the food wa awful and the service wa terrible we were sat next to a group of drunken passenger who were loud and were continued to be served drink throughout i am sure this didn t make the cabin crew job easy but they seemed quite disorganised running out of drink etc a we were sitting in the back of the plane there seemed to be no choice by the time we were offered food the crew were not really interested when asked about an alternative they forgot to come back to u and when asked again they offered exactly what we refused the food wa poor quality dry hard chicken with very little flavour breakfast wa an egg mayonnaise roll and again there wa no alternative i paid extra to fly with british airway but found the service and food lacking really would not recommend flying long haul with them if you can help it you can see they have made cut to the budget,negative
london heathrow to bologna return in british airway club europe very disappointing the seat are basically the same a economy seat they just don t sit someone in the middle seat so no meaningful increase in legroom or width food wa very average on the way out salad with very dry prawn pretty tasteless but nice on the way back tagliatelle staff were on the whole were good but given the seat i wouldn t recommend spending the extra money for club europe,positive
checked in online for our british airway flight from larnaca to heathrow and discovered my wife and i were seated row apart no seat together were available in the seating chart under manage my booking is the ba software so poor that it can t keep seat together when booked at the same time the answer must be yes the check in person said they would try and get u two seat together when we presented at the gate but a usual when you present at the bag drop the staff member will say whatever is necessary to get you away and through security with minimum fuss and delay in this case needless to say our separate seating remained separate i wouldn t take the trouble to record this here except that i have felt irritated for the last few flight i ve done with british airway with poor food in flight entertainment screen that work intermittently faulty headphone or being seated so that the only screen available is the other side of the business class dividing curtain which wa drawn half way through the film i ve preferred british airway on the basis that some of the budget operator charge you the same by the time you add their various extra charge i m now coming to the conclusion that if they charge the same i might a well fly with them and then i won t have to wait an extra min to get off the plane while the business class punter get off first,negative
after a small delay in am we departed for short hop to lhr boarding went quickly we were assigned emergency exit seat which were very comfortable at cruising altitude we got breakfast snack the crew wa friendly except the one assigned to our section who wasn t very talkative and a bit snobby overall flight experience wa great and service is the way we like to see it british airway ranking,positive
our british airway flight to mia departed on time and wa full we were seated in the middle front row which ha extra legroom and the ife screen and traytables are stored in the seat the first thing that caught our attention wa the state of the cabin and the interior looked old and worn the same go for the ife and seat although the seat were comfortable by form and shape they were worn and a bit hard to sit on i had trouble with my ife the whole flight a it froze and continuously reset itself while trying to watch a movie that wa very annoying but the cabin crew reset the system a couple of time and weren t annoyed by my question about the problem the cabin crew service wa excellent a wa food,negative

i used british airway club europe from lgw to naples basically the flight is the same a long haul economy except no entertainment and the middle seat is left empty a far a i can tell there is no difference in legroom and seat are identical to economy i m not sure how british airway can pas this off a business class my advice if booking a business class flight in europe look at competitor otherwise book economy and save the money only really good thing about flight wa an amazing cabin staff that looked after u really well,positive

i fly about time a month of the time with british airway i m not sure what is going on with british airway but their service is just getting worse and worse you can see the individual are trying but it seems the business just doesn t want them to be able to deliver that world class first service they owned for all those year i can only assume it s about cost cutting a their plane are so dated and falling to bit now especially when you compare it other airline like cathay or american airline in all honesty if you can fly an alternate airline you ll probably get a better first class cabin and cheaper i d recommend it also how doe this airline not have wifi on their long haul yet once a pioneer of the air world british airway is now a half dead dinosaur with no real sense of direction,negative
i am a very regular traveller with british airway and i am currently executive club gold oneworld emerald i have recently flown with a heap of other oneworld airline and feel british airway service slipping rapidly the crew are smile when you enter the cabin but when you are served the smile seem a bit absent and the service i would describe a passable compared with cathay pacific where crew will approach the premier status customer with a full welcome regardless of class and give that extra special attention making you feel of value this is absent with british airway still the flight wa short and pleasant enough i got exit seat and the legroom wa very good not very good in the standard economy seat and being m it a squeeze but all that you need for a hour flight,positive
london city to granada i ve flown with ba a lot over the year most recently in business and first and have until recently always had a favourable opinion of them i recently used avios to take a short break to granada with my brother my normal choice for such a short flight would have been economy because i don t believe the extra cost whether this be actual money or avios justifies the perceived benefit regrettably no economy reward seat were available so i opted for club europe the only real benefit on this particular route wa the increased baggage allowance although this wa of no real use for a to day trip so what did we get for our business flight no lounge at city airport no fast track at city airport a holding pen prior to boarding with everyone standing around in a small room and no priority boarding seat in club europe are identical to those in economy the breakfast going out wa terrible burnt food along with dried out toast and croissant the lunch if you can call it that coming back wa also terrible a cold salad dish with dried out roll accompanied by vinegary wine no lounge at granada no fast track at granada coupled with a single check in desk most of the time and long queue i complained to ba about this the initial response wa that club europe left the middle seat free to allow more room whoever responded obviously didn t even think to check the aircraft a there is no middle seat on the embraer it s a x configuration for the whole aircraft after some considerable persistence on my part a partial refund of avios each wa provided by british airway i recently had the choice of flying club world to hawaii ba to lax and then aa to hnl but given the fact that british airway club world can be quite claustrophobic ultimately decided to try out qatar airway new business class to thailand via doha by all account their business class is comparable to british airway first class i shall review this some time next year,negative

lhr phx sept last few time i ve flown british airway i d been forced to consider ba a a discount airline that doesn t deserve it star rating and i wa not looking forward to this flight we had awful seat at the back of a very full plane so asked at bag drop about upgrade paid each to go up to wtp a bargain when added to the price we paid for our seat in coach and it wa worth it doe anyone know why we check in online or go to a self serve kiost but still have to go to bag drop to pretty much go through the check in process again boarding went a usual smiley welcome aboard and to our seat this aircraft had wtp immediately behind first good leg room comfortable seat small cabin of it own a small amenity pack is provided although most of the stuff in it is inferior and hardly worth having only one fa worked our cabin but he wa friendly and efficient and the lack of more staff wa not noticable drink trolley and lunch menu then food served lunch with option china plate real cutlery napkin etc food wa very good even though only one option left by time we were served had beef which wa tasty and tender and well presented a snack box wa passed out a few hour later and dinner served hour before landing interestingly dinner wa from economy foil dish plastic cutlery paper napkin given the price of wtp ticket would have expected better then that only one juice water round but fa were in the galley and happy to get whatever you wanted until we drank tham out of bubble being an older plane the ife wa ancient with a very small screen that had grid line showing and a barely adequate movie selection noise cancelling headset wa not the best and hurt my ear ife wa only a minor irritation a flight wa scheduled hour and i wa more interested in comfort which wtp provided only real gripe is the tray table it fold out of the seat arm a a drink tray then unfolds to a full tray problem is drink slide off when in small mode and you have to brace the full tray on your knee to stop your dinner sliding off british airway is relying on it past reputation rather than providing a good product these day and i avoid them if i can because of that i didn t think i would be saying this but i enjoyed this flight and it wa probably the best ba flight i ve had a shame then that i will still avoid british airway if i can,positive
i have not got a far a even flying with british airway this time around and the customer service are a nightmare sent an email with flight confirmation and agreed time to u yet a later email tell u different time they say we need to take it up with vueling their sister company call vueling and are told it is a british airway issue none of them will take responsibility for changing our flight time without asking it s now too late to get an alternative flight at a reasonable price so have to return at a stupid time in the morning which ha ruined our anniversary weekend break no compensation or anything horrible greedy company who thankfully are in decline pay a bit more and fly with genuine or star airline about level below cathay pacific and the rest around that price bracket,negative
british airway introduced it new club europe business class which is basically economy class minus the middle seat leg room is same a in economy when i asked flight crew what s new about it she indicated with her hand that the seat were more cramped now it is a shame that british airway ha fallen prey to greed and instead of upgrading it business product it ha introduced a very poor product on club europe food wa poor and so wa the inflight service if the person in front reclines it is impossible to even hold a newspaper and read it i will never fly british airway club europe again,negative
british airway from heathrow to vancouver outbound toronto heathrow inbound both on rather ancient boeing both flight operated within minute of schedule and the fare wa competitive check in and bag delivery wa fine at all airport the aircraft interior were shabby at best seat uncomfortable ife hopeless food awful cabin crew were mixed one or two fairly pleasant but most going about their duty in a perfunctory way one male cabin crew member wa so overweight and sweating profusely it wa astounding that he could still be allowed to fly from the good day of quality service in the s british airway have gradually deteriorated into a third class carrier and can never hope to compete on customer service with the airline from the middle and far east what a shame,negative
glasgow to cape town via heathrow with british airway and the short flight from glasgow to heathrow wa fine exit row seat with plenty of room although the catering wa a bit bizarre a drink and a packet of crisp the flight to cape town wa however a different story the boeing used wa well past a major refurbishment both inside and out the economy class seating wa very squashed together with virtually no room to move and i m only tall the seat back entertainment screen must be first generation tiny screen with a grid of line on it i ve seen smart phone with bigger screen the crew in our section were a bit perfunctory in their duty apart from one female who smiled and chatted with and i quote her guest and who made the flight a bit more bearable the food on offer wa standard economy class fare it filled a gap just the flight time for ba is hour so british airway really need to improve the inflight quality of their long haul flight in term of a bit more room and better catering for economy class passenger who do make up the majority of people on board not the premium passenger the old british airway corporate slogan the world favourite airline are long gone for our next flight to south africa or elsewhere i think it will be back to klm for u,positive

i have flown regularly with british airway between the uk and other european country where economy class seat are leather and reasonable onboard service based on previous experience i decided to make an intercontinental flight between the uk and rio de janeiro brazil believing that i would find at least the same comfort offered on european route by british airway it wa not instead of decent seat condition expected for a hour duration flight i found seat that barely accommodate a normal person not so tall not overweight and completely unable to have a decent meal during the flight the economy class of british airway can be defined a simply terrible do not waste your money by paying a bit more believing you will find comfort in an intercontinental flight flying economy class with british airway just buy the cheapest promotional airline ticket that you find on market you ll be served the same way and will save some money,positive

short flight from london to paris but completely full easy check in and smooth boarding problem is how inconsistent british airway is in regard to baggage allowed in the cabin some people have two or three big bag when i thought only one wa allowed so this then put pressure on passenger with just one to put in the locker with the crew trying to get them to put the bag by their foot why should they i carry less on the plane to be able to have foot space why should i give that up when someone else brings on more bag this need to be looked at short flight on time and service on board ok given that timeframe,positive
we were delayed going out from heathrow to bangkok but were notified by british airway before our journey to the airport the seat were reasonably tight but being economy i expected that the plane wa freezing both there and back every one wa given a blanket so wrap up warm the film choice wasn t good and don t book seat next to the toilet seat row number in the s you will always get served last and they do run out,positive
la vega to london heathrow with british airway what we were expecting and what we got are two separate thing we boarded the aircraft on time and were greeted at the doorway but once inside the cabin crew were more interested in themselves and chatting no help anywhere we settled into our seat which were narrow and very cramped and the heat in the cabin wa very uncomfortable to the point that the majority of the passenger were fanning themselves down with safety card the service commenced once the flight wa underway and free drink were offered and if you fancied a beer the only choice wa lager or lite lager the meal commenced shortly after and my wife had ordered a lactose free meal which she wa given or so she thought until she looked closely and everything contained dairy product this wa changed when it wa brought to the attention the of the crew and looking back i think she would have been better with the wrong choice that wa given and suffered the consequence a it looked unappetising bland and who know what it wa no vegetable no meat the rest of the meal were served or should i say thrown at u offering pasta or chicken the attitude from the cabin crew wa very poor and some were rude and arrogant for the majority of the flight the cabin crew were invisible one of the screen in the seatback wasn t working so this wa rectified minute after the cabin crew being told why aren t these thing checked prior to boarding the space you get in economy is abysmal the person in front of me put his seat back and wa nearly lying on me the leg room is shocking and the seat uncomfortable my son couldn t eat his meal until the person in front put the seat up a he couldn t see it the cabin crew should make an announcement when meal are served for passenger to upright the seat out of courtesy to the people behind or tell people when they re serving meal no they don t a it would be too much of an effort for them the only good thing about the flight wa arriving early so we could get off it would we fly british airway again on this experience no you would have more room in a tin of sardine british airway need to get their finger out and start offering a quality service to everybody on the flight not just the passenger in the posh seat and maybe send some of the staff on a customer care course,negative
ghastly describes the british airway experience in a single word the new club europe seat are not fit for purpose at all when it come to a hour flight it s impossible to stretch out because there is no space and i am only foot tall it s impossible to work because there is insufficient space and it s impossible to relax but the new seat barely recline this is by no stretch of the imagination a quality airline product for anyone prepared to pay a premium do yourself a favour and give your money to another airline,positive
i used british airway to hong kong in and remember vowing to never use them again however a i needed to get to new york and back quickly i had to use british airway and i thought they may have bucked up their idea the flight to nyc wa on a boeing which really did need an uplift the seat and decor wa tired and the staff rude the entertainment system wa terrible and limited on the return flight i wa on a boeing and although slightly more modern the entertainment again wa limited and the control unit didn t work the staff were better than the previous flight however british airway did manage to mislay my baggage between nyc and manchester and i received it hour later battered and missing some clip and thankfully nothing broken inside i ve decided that whenever i fly eastw i ll continue using emirate or singapore airline both of a far higher quality than british airway and to the usa maybe virgin have to be better than ba surely i ll never use ba again,positive

london to new york jfk is the most profitable route for british airway my ticket cost nearly return i fly fortnightly between london and new york jfk the aircraft are tired food is poor even the new gourmet business class food british airway management should try the breakfast porridge with salt and blueberry what about the afternoon tea sandwich yuk toilet often out of service and on my last flight at least of the toilet ha been out of service the last flight ba on wednesday september the power failed meaning all the seat in my section of business class had to be manually positioned the in flight entertainment system stopped the staff were great but frankly all the company is doing is putting staff in a difficult position in my company will have spent k on travel to and from london and new york too much money for such a mediocre service aircraft that are many year beyond proper serviceability and a management team focused on shareholder profit not customer satisfaction what a fall from grace in august i flew singapore airline london to melbourne what a difference in aircraft quality customer service experience and value for money please british airway sort yourselves out letter to keith williams or willie walsh are ignored or intercepted by staff lot of promise and little or no action my most recent cabin wa held together by pipe insulator the last one the same and horrible condensation issue with the air con resulting in a soaked blanket at take off,positive
compared to the like of eva air or qatar airway british airway club world is by far the poor relation flew from glasgow to new york via lhr the seat have zero storage apart from the small drawer at floor level it is astonishing that for the money they charge you have to step over the leg of the person on your outside especially if you accidentally trip and land on top of them food wa satisfactory although a small bacon roll for breakfast wa again a poor show avod wa also satisfactory apart from the flat bed this just really doesn t have a premium feel about it on our recent trip on both leg the crew were excellent but the product from our national flag carrier simply is not worth the premium price they charge,positive
excellent british airway flight from heathrow to johannesburg my second flight on the a which smooth quiet and very comfortable i think ba have improved both service and food to a good standard my husband and i fly very regularly and found the meal on this flight enjoyable much better than emirate however ba had a disappointing selection of film,positive
lhr arn lhr with british airway return th and st august check in online quick a wa bag drop at t used gallery sth lounge which i ve always liked breakfast on offer at am boarding quick however the use of a bus to a remote stand always feel odd at an airline hub newish aircraft with new club europe seating first time using this layout and must say felt not much different to economy flight away on time service ok with english breakfast on offer crew ok landed a little early return check in quick and easy although rd party lounge is just ok flight departed on time lasting hr min crew pretty nice and the old ce layout on this a appeared comfier afternoon tea served which wa ok flight arrived a little late but on to a stand so no bus trip i m unsure if club in europe is still worth the extra i have a few more ba european flight coming up so will judge once i ve used economy and club once more,positive
london heathrow to dubai in british airway first class the trip got off to a good start with the concorde lounge at terminal very comfortable and private however showing sign of wear and tear need a bit of a refurb boarding wa announced and we promptly left however only just made it to the gate very odd but i am no fan of the train to the strange satellite terminal for boarding the plane wa a very old refurbished boeing quite why ba hang on to these gas guzzler is a mystery i estimate the plane over it life so far ha done about million mile enough to get to the moon much criticism ha been said about cramming so many first suite into the nose of the plane and i can say that is fully justified it wa a day flight so not worried about sleeping but if it were a night flight a a tall but not overweight man i would struggle to get comfortable it s like a coffin and storage space for personal effect not worth a light a cabin crew told me they will hang on to the newer boeing s for another year if so this is truly unbelievable given the emirate competition on this route their fantastic suite and they always serve caviar one doe wonder if the sale and marketing people at british airway have a clue how to entice customer to the overall experience there is so much criticism of british airway on this site one wonder why they don t listen it can only be perceived a arrogance food wa fine very nice mezza nice soup and spicy middle eastern style chicken not bad at all champagne very basic and krug ha long vanished from british airway route cabin crew were terrific faultless travelling a boeing on the way back hopefully a better seat,positive
brussels to heathrow with british airway lounge at brussels very acceptable plenty of space reasonable snack i wouldn t call it a meal plane pushed back on time and we were airborne in minute the flight to lhr wa just minute and straight in without stacking landing from the east barely enough time for a meal but a number of passenger took advantage of the reasonable looking prawn salad i wa happy with a couple of gin and tonic seated in row one so leg room wa okay in the strange new club europe seat overall not bad,positive
on the upper deck on ba aug st although the equipment is relatively new once you are in those hideous seat you wouldn t be aware of what aircraft you are on squeezing a many ying yang seat onto an aircraft doe not constitute a premium cabin experience british airway missed a great opportunity to enhance their club world product but while other carrier improved their cabin ba seem content in leading the race to the bottom the crew on this flight looked a though they did mot wish to be on duty and one in particular wa really obnoxious to a child the child s parent were certainly mare tolerant than i would have been crew turned a blind eye to two passenger who decided to retain their luggage from the overhead locker while the aircraft wa still climbing and the seat belt sign were still illuminated once the food wa served crew were nowhere to be seen until breakfast wa served due to the awful food served on this route on a previous trip i ate before boarding so cannot comment what the offering were on this sector the club kitchen is a complete waste of time i did attempt to have a snack from the club kitchen during the overnight flight after negotiating the outstretched leg of a sleeping passenger but the unlabeled sandwich were chilled out of their existence and were inedible british airway really need to up their game in respect of offering a premium cabin service,positive
i can confirm what ha been reported earlier about british airway long haul flight our plane wa really old and most staff were almost the same the tv screen wa almost impossible to watch because of the distorted picture and the seat felt like on an ikea couch from the s the usual food choice of pasta or chicken wa reduced to chicken only on top of that we were hr delayed due to bad servicing of one of the engine which needed a spare part only available in the uk disaster at the check in counter when traveller were asking for accomodation british airway had no strategy to handle such a situation which caused hour of unnecessary waiting in the queue hotel voucher given for hotel that do not exist we had to find a room for two small kid on our own at almost midnight this wa definitely the last flight with british airway,negative
thoroughly disappointed with this supposed legacy airline having been delayed for an hour on my british airway connecting flight to lhr and stuck overnight at a heathrow hotel i wa looking forward to getting going on the morning flight reality check this aircraft is old and decrepit and wa built in the s it should have been retired long ago a quick google search show that this aircraft make up the majority of ba s longhaul fleet the seat are so small and narrow that you are constantly playing elbow hockey with the people on either side of you i am ft and weigh kg so how a larger person might survive is beyond me everything is old and look it too even the staff the seat are worn to the point that you can feel every piece of the metal frame beneath in fact the lady seated in front of me complained to the cabin crew because she could feel the miniature tropicana bottle i had put the seat pocket even the safety animation video look like it wa made a a school it project by year old staff are cold and unfriendly it would seem that their contract forbid smiling of any kind the inflight entertainment screen are smaller than a regular smartphone and have large visible pixel it is a struggle to actually see what is being displayed they are running on brand image only and even then there s only fume left in tank do not fly ba at least until they seriously upgrade their fleet,negative
plane wa clean staff amiable and present with delivery of juice and water through the flight dinner on departure wa fine maybe a little dry but otherwise tasty enough the seatback screen wa tiny but selection of entertainment wa good the picture quality wa rather poor the black mark wa the pathetic breakfast croissant wa inedible partly frozen tasteless and it seemed like most of the folk seated nearby did not even open the plastic wrapper two cup of tea and a muesli bar wa ample my wife and i were travelling on different itinerary with british airway and this wa one flight we shared i asked time for the agent to link the booking which she did ba computer did not perform properly so we were seated apart no drama since the plane wa only about full and we sorted it out ok this wa part of a round the world ticket so i have no idea on the value for money question for this sector,positive
flight home after a week break in various part of europe the cabin crew were fantastic made u me and my australian companion very welcome and were most accommodating throughout our flight home cannot fault the service,positive
great flight with ba departure at milan wa great despite a small delay to the flight relatively empty flight and so could stretch out seat wa very comfortable cabin crew were great and encouraged people to order more drink and have more food and couldn t do enough for people overall the best of ba great arrival at t even with having a checked bag wa out in min,positive
my wife and i flew from toronto to london return using ba business class in july of this year this wa part of a trip of a lifetime we had planned to the uk we have never flown business class so decided to spend the big dollar for a return trip i am not sure if it wa worth it at all toronto to london wa an overnight flight london to toronto an afternoon flight ease of booking online wa very good customer service on phone wa poor obviously outsourced so a language barrier check in at toronto wa average nothing above check in at any other counter lounge at toronto very good great food drink service facility aircraft cabin with average state of wear seat center rear facing seat comfortable but lacking any type of space the lie flat bed wa good cabin crew were on auto pilot not rude but certainly not great food wa average the return trip heathrow terminal to toronto wa not really any better the business class lounge at heathrow wa not good lousy food look very worn very busy traveler sleeping across multiple seat bathroom were average i would have rather taken my chance in the regular lounge area or gone into one of the many sit down restaurant the distance from the main concourse after security to the lounge is quite long and the distance to your gate especially if it is in the b or c section is a great distance and involves a train ride same seat on the return trip so again average food service etc all average overall we were not impressed with british airway business and would not use them again consider air canada or another airline i flew air transat club class month prior to the uk and i enjoyed it a lot more and a hell of a lot cheaper british airway did not impress,positive
i didn t really know what to expect from this flight it had been a couple of year since my last ba flight gatwick to nice in that case we were on our way to lyon airport from the city centre and noticed the flight had only just departed london upon arrival at the airport we found it to be delayed by minute with little information given a to why when we finally got round to boarding there wa no organisation a bit like every man for himself what amused me wa that the captain came on over the pa and encouraged passenger to hurry and take their seat a we had only minute to keep our slot safe to say because of the lack of organisation we missed our slot and we sat on the aircraft for another minute while we awaited a new slot the captain kept u informed a best he could the cabin crew showed no effort at all they showed no will to actually be there they didn t check on passenger bearing in mind it wa c outside and this wa affecting the temperature inside the aircraft once we took off the service seemed rushed i wasn t able to get any food at the airport so wa hoping for something that would keep me full on the journey back no so much a pitiful ham and cheese bun thing and a drink there wa no personal touch to it a we were approaching heathrow all we could hear from the rear galley we were in the back row wa the two crew complaining about their hour i m flying with ba citiflyer to dublin in september if the service hasn t improved i ll think twice if i really need to travel ba again,positive
given ba s bizarre and relentless assault on it premium passenger dropped back to economy a no point flying club europe given seat leg room now the same nice new interior so clean adequate seat flight left on time quick baggage pick up didn t bother with the sandwich offered my daughter did couldn t really see any difference than the sandwich being offered in club except it s served in a box crew made no effort to disguise their desire to be somewhere else overall i expected little and so not disappointed decent value for money but just another flight and a few hour to watch a film on the ipad,negative
london to miami return flew out with child one wa an infant turning during holiday had necessary booking for seat on return and booking number and email assuring me booking were linked and there would be no issue upon checking in to return wa met with rude staff who commented don t even touch that it s hassle just refer her to ticketing where i spent the next two hour waiting for them to check me in my flight closed and took off without me despite me constantly stressing that i had a child with a fractured leg and medical assistance all linked to the flight long story short i wa dumped on next flight after hour waiting at desk with child no explanation of what wa going on people being served all around me by person who wa supposed to be dealing with me no child meal were transferred and all assistance wa abandoned a wa connected with previous flight resulted in me being stranded at heathrow a my seater taxi had left and wa impossible to book another however this wasn t all check in staff went on to tell me that my kilo case could not be boarded a it wa too heavy under health and safety regulation i had to throw away kilo worth of clothing this wa despite me being kilo under my overall baggage allowance and receiving a sticker labelled heavy bag must not weigh more than kilo had a further hour wait at the other end a all medical assistance booked had not been transferred a requested would never fly british airway again due to the complete and utter incompetence of the ground staff at miami,negative
i have been flying with british airway on the lhr gva route for a while now and the original excellent service ha been declining i am an executive club silver member and due to change to the executive club i am now earning a lot less avios and tier point than i used to also the slimmer seat on the aircraft in this case a rather old a are much less comfortable and roomy i find it quite tight and i am not especially tall at ft the cabin crew were not particularly attentive but friendly they barely bothered with the passenger onboard even though the flight wa nearly empty overall it is disappointing that our flag carrier is becoming more like ryanair with every enhancment they make i have recently tried swiss on this route and they were cheaper and provided a superior service,positive
the sad decline of our national flag carrier seems to be continuing unabated i fly the lhr phx lhr route on a monthly basis and although i ve spoken to colleague about changing carrier a ba offer the only direct route into phoenix i have stuck with them but where to begin the s used are ageing shabby and tired if they were your old horse they d have been taken to the knacker s yard year ago throughout the aircraft the seating is uncomfortable space cramped and onboard facility lacking and limited the avod in economy and the premium variant is restarted with almost comical regularity the screen are smaller than most of u have fitted in our car so you are either squinting or just unable to see the movie you are trying to watch when the person in front reclines the screen is almost forced into your face such is the limited legroom catering is just awful in the economy cabin and only marginally better in business although i see the airline is getting around this now by allowing the the privilege of paying for a meal upgrade one word of caution here if you are upgraded your meal stay behind despite you paying for it all in all ba is slipping against the competition and delay are common place a to be expected lhr lounge are in need of a complete makeover and it s a rarity to get more than a couple of cabin staff who seem happy in their work i ve one more ba flight to go and then it s adieu from me but then given how they so sparingly issue tier point now it s not like i m going to miss them,negative
did this same trip last summer with delay etc but thought we had just been unlucky but history repeated itself all leg were delayed technical issue or weather were blamed ba do not seem to have much in the way of contingency plan and particularly where terminal at heathrow is concerned it take very little weather to throw the whole place into confusion at all point information wa lacking or contradictory i cannot decide if they lie or are so inept that they do not communicate with each other eg our internal flight home wa showing a being subject to big delay for hour online when we arrived at the gate the delay wa announced a a sudden crew issue a new thing this year seemed to be to bring out the captain to speak to passenger maybe we were supposed to be charmed this happened both at heathrow and boston on the long haul flight the seat were tiny the internal one were better which seems strange on both long haul leg of the journey the entertainment system did not work and the food wa lamentable and definitely worse than a few year ago the cabin crew were nice but that s about it,negative
the british airway plane i flew on from larnaca an ageing wa clearly tired and while clean looked frayed around the edge club europe offer a free seat next to you but this wa not on offer on the so it also felt a little cramped especially a the seat is no different from the economy seat food wa acceptable but not the best i have been offered on european business class flight,negative
absolutely disappointing experience flight wa delayed by more than hour but ground staff were unfriendly and unwilling to help arrange transport option even though plane touched down after midnight with no public transport option available reason wa claimed to be weather but both aberdeen and london experienced good weather with no other flight being delayed in both location concocted reason to fool passenger would not recommend this airline previous two flight have been delayed for at least an hour each,negative
not sure who invented these seat but they are awful difficult to get in and out if you are inside ha not flown british airway for a number of year but they have not improved in this time food still very mediocre and service the same you even had to pay in advance to select a seat which we did however when we checked in we were told sorry crew using the seat you paid for still waiting for my refund inflight entertainment is rubbish movie well past their sell by date back to emirate for u,negative
i do not like this new business class arrangement in short haul i am wondering if is is worth paying a premium for no extra leg room and a side table new seat are better service attentive food okay,positive
slight delay game advertised on website not able to access in economy tv not working for st hour then when it did couldn t hear it though the provided headphone so had to choose film with subtitle although staff doing their job the near u seemed to have an attitude a man behind asked for a cup of tea and the flight assistant muttered under his breath my partially sighted mother asked politely for milk with her tea and the flight assistant made her feel stupid by shoving it in her face and sarcastically saying there it is i realise she didn t know my mother wa partially sighted but maybe she should be aware that you can t always see people s disability i had no problem with our outbound flight to denver from heathrow except the headphone the staff on that plane were all very pleasant i will think twice before booking ba again,negative
a slight delay in boarding ba scheduled departure resulted in priority boarding being suspended for general boarding hardly had the wheel left the ground before the person in row f i wa seated in f reclined his seat back a far a it would go when one of the cabin crew walked past seat belt sign still on i asked if this wa allowed to my astonishment i wa told that yes it wa it wa my understanding that the seat back must be in the upright position while the seatbelt sign is on during climb,negative
check in agent at glasgow wa very cheerful and polite both crew were efficient and polite if not particularly engaging in economy it wa a very standard service i like the new seat on both aircraft what i don t like is having to transfer from t to t at heathrow over the past several year i seem to always end up travelling to the destination requiring this transfer which add a lot of time and hassle to what would be an extremely efficient domestic to international connection at t,positive
flew from gatwick on to genoa to join a cruise whilst the aircraft wa clean everything else seems to be very old and fit for purpose for a display at a museum at the back only one toilet wa working seat very cramped and not comfortable it wa an am flight to my horror only a small cold croissant with a bit of none descriptive cheese in the middle wa served with a hot drink bearing in mind the flight price on skyscanner for could have cost over gbp pound in the good old day british airway flight from manchester to heathrow lasting about an hour served hot breakfast it appears british airway doe not want to maintain it quality image and i am really disappointed on this flight,negative
this wa my first flight on a british airway aircraft with the new slimmer seat and i wa quite appalled by the seat pitch space between row the seat back in front of me i wa seated in c wa so close to my face that i could not hold up a magazine to read i had to try to twist sideways in my seat and hold the magazine in the aisle i passed on the light breakfast that wa served because it just seemed like too much trouble to try and eat from a plastic box that would have been almost pressed against my chest the cabin crew on my flight wa very pleasant and professional and the aircraft interior wa immaculate but in the future i ll avoid british airway within europe the single aisle aircraft of air france which i fly regularly are far more comfortable,positive
they sold me ticket without any luggage allowance i paid to add bag using their online system when i took the return flight they charged me again but this time double so a reasonable pound flight ended up costing me i ll never fly with them again they re more expensive than everyone else and they ve totally changed their luggage term what a complete rip off,negative
no problem on this short flight left and arrived on time drink and snack served,negative
not impressed the cabin crew lacked energy and enthusiasm poor service there wa also rubbish left in the pocket of the seat in front of me when i boarded the plane there were food crumb on the table when i unclipped it and the magazine looked well used i expected more from british airway i won t be flying with them again,positive
wa upgraded at the gate from club world to first class on a full flight i am a loyal ba customer since and a gold tier member wa welcomed and shown my seat and the friendly young male flight attendant put my cabin bag in the overhead bin before i did so the suite ha been modified a bit from the b but the seat remains the same comfortable but with a poorly designed footrest i opted for the tasting menu for lunch it wa quite good but the food quality wa not up to cathay pacific or emirate first class standard high tea wa quite average due to the dry sandwich the washroom were clean but minimal and the club world washroom on the upper deck of the a are much nicer pajama and a wash bag were offered avod wa good in flight service by the same fa wa very good but the finesse of excellent first class service wa lacking a bit still he wa always visible throughout the flight and that wa good arrived on time at iad and the bag were on the carousel quickly,positive
i have been a loyal ba customer since maintaining gold tier membership in recent year and silver tier for many prior year ba is consistent in the seat type it offer on it long haul fleet but in flight service and food can vary greatly i connected from a qatar airway short haul flight in doh to ba at hamad international airport i used the al mourjan business class lounge and it worked out well ba s gate staff in doh were clearly not familiar with the to fly to serve slogan judging by their attitude that day apart from a choice of water or orange juice upon boarding the club world cabin no service wa provided on the very short hop to bah the flight attendant one in particular who served from bah to lhr were very good it wa a sleeper service so the dinner menu wa minimal but breakfast didn t compensate well for that either cost cutting wa evident here thankfully i didn t have to jump over anyone to access the aisle a many adjacent seat were empty the cabin wa clean and avod wa adequate though it froze near lhr the flight landed on time in lhr but transferring through t wa chaotic at am baggage transfer wa good,positive
easy check in at t and good passport security gate transit flight boarded min late due to issue with airbridge ba wt cabin in good order with nice welcome aboard avios worked must have been lucky young flight crew so i assume new mf type so not that much interaction but non the less efficient food for both dinner and breakfast flight made up some time so nearly on schedule bag first of carousel so all in all a good travel experience,positive
we flew with british airway to st lucia on flight number ba on and returned on flight number ba on the journey to st lucia wa pleasant enough a we were upgraded from economy to premium economy due to spare seat unfortunately however the upgrade meant that my husband and i no longer had seat together a i ha with the seat i d pre booked and a this wa our honeymoon this wa quite important for u the journey home however wa extremely disappointing on finding our seat we discovered that the plane had not been cleaned since the previous journey there were empty sweet wrapper in the pocket and crumb all over the seat and on the floor we were not offered a new pillow and blanket and instead we re left the one used by previous customer in my case blanket scrunched up on floor with pillow on top in comparison with other long haul flight we have travelled on with virgin and emirate s british airway seemed to provide much less space and poorer facility needless to say the flight wa an uncomfortable one for many reason on future holiday we will be returning to other flight operator,positive
ground handling is not great at bari but once on board wa quickly forgotten great flight with attentive cabin crew delicious afternoon tea with unlimited champagne very good experience,positive
very nice and helpful staff in terminal very nice and friendly cabin crew food wa good too very smooth flight and on time i have flown time in last two week with different flight and i wa flying with my year old son british airway wa the only flight where the cabin crew came from time to time came to ask if my child needed anything she brought him a bag with a colouring book and pen without asking,positive
a very smooth and pleasant flight from start to finish the bag drop queue at terminal wa long but moved reasonably fast onboard a small snack of crisp and a drink wa served which wa fine the flight operated on time my only quibble wa that a label wa put on my backpack instructing me to keep it at my foot presumably so that other people with unreasonably large take on bag could easily put them in the overhead bin while i suffered less legroom than them apart from the safety issue of hand baggage stuck on the floor this policy penalises people who do the right thing and encourages others to take big item of hand luggage come on ba enforce a your hand luggage rule and don t penalise considerate passenger,positive
the staff were not friendly or even helpful a pregnant lady beside me asked for help with her carry on and the rude answer wa if you can t carry it don t bring it on board my husband asked for an extra pillow and he wa told only one pillow per passenger the lady beside my daughter wa not given food and when she asked for it the flight attendant answered in a loud voice i did ask you which did not happen don t fly this airline unless you have no other choice,negative

first time travelling in a premium class so compared with economy it wa great check in at lhr wa quick and we were grateful of the additional baggage allowance in club europe the fast track through security wa also welcome the gallery lounge in t wa excellent we were welcomed and given a quick overview of the lounge the breakfast in the lounge offered everything from cereal to pastry to hot sandwich a well a tea coffee juice water and a wide selection of alcohol there wa also a great view of the runway which my son enjoyed the service on board the flight itself offered hot towel prior to take off then a full english breakfast with real cutlery and plate warm bread roll and choice of drink the legroom wa excellent and the seat wa comfortable they are laid out in the same x configuration a economy but the middle seat ha a table over it which give you extra room to place your item a you are near the front of the plane disembarkation wa quick and we were at the carousel before our case the return journey wa much the same and although the lounge at bcn did not offer anywhere near such a good selection of food the seating wa far superior to lhr the meal on the way back wa a selection of spanish meat with cheese olive and a spicy mousse together with the usual selection of drink we were able to use the fast track through passport control at lhr which avoided a long queue and meant we were out of the airport and in our car within an hour overall this wa a fantastic experience for me and my family who usually travel in economy,positive
i wish i could comment on the service on the aircraft but with a hour delay i am unable to and can only comment on the ground service after being informed the aircraft wa delayed because of a technical fault it is not the technical fault i am worried about but the way the problem wa handled by ba s ground staff at johannesburg s or tambo airport the cabin crew had arrived at hr and boarded the plane which wa due to depart at hr to london at hr the announcement came that the flight wa not boarding and passenger should wait to be escorted to the arrival area to collect baggage the chaos then started people close to the boarding desk sought to find out information and the possibility of alternative flight which were fully booked after about minute passenger were told to go to arrival where ba staff would be there to assist got to arrival nobody wa there to even tell passenger which carousel to go to a series of late announcement then informed passenger to collect luggage and go to the arrival area to seek hotel voucher nobody wa directing passenger at each stage passenger were congregating under an electronic sign that said south african airway domestic transfer to collect voucher the line slinked back into the arrival area only two service agent were dealing with all passenger chaotic scene no line for family or premium passenger in the end no voucher were given and free for all to just know which hotel to go to no clear announcement given at any stage to passenger all airline have issue which mean a plane will be cancelled it is how the issue is dealt with that show professionalism and a basic duty of care to passenger in this case there wa nobody in charge nobody undertaking line management and nobody providing one source of information a true shamble passenger arrived at the hotel not knowing when the aircraft would leave scheduled to leave hr after original departure or what the real problem wa rumour only flying club and having a ba gold card with gold list status meant nothing,negative
pretty poor experience flying with ba staff were not enthusiastic about taking care of passenger food portion were insufficient online check in wa a problem ba wa able to process my payment for upgrading seat but once they took my money the website stopped working and no longer let me select seat or check in ba is more expensive than virgin atlantic and delivers worse service virgin allows passenger to pick their seat on booking ba charge passenger for that option i ve booked ticket on transatlantic flight over the past year ba virgin delta and by far the best experience wa virgin delta i wont be booking ba not very good value for money,negative
the crew were very enthusiastic and helpful the service wa very fast and we were served a drink and a snack for such a short flight it wa great i would recommend,positive

flight wa picked because it got u from riyadh saudi arabia to newcastle uk in a reasonable amount of time what ba failed to inform anyone wa that despite advertising the flight from ruh to lhr a landing at am bst at lhr is that plane cannot land at lhr before am so once landed and they taxied to the apron we had little time to get through transit to catch the newcastle flight we made it and got to newcastle only to find that our two suitcase were there but my golf bag which i had paid for did not make that flight it did make the next flight to newcastle but i had already had to set off to make an appointment some mile from newcastle it took day for my golf bag to arrive at where i wa staying not one word of apology from ba the seat on the flight were ok service of crew satisfactory the headset didn t work from ruh to lhr and i tried three set best part wa the hot bacon sandwich between lhr and ncl,positive
i have been a long time supporter of ba but they have successfully managed to degrade the economy product to such an appalling level that i suspect that u based carrier now offer a better product from ridiculously expensive fee to book seat in advance to child sized low quality meal on board to plane on our route that only offer the dense configuration and new policy limiting the amount of avios you can earn with economy ticket i have had enough my partner and i left both the transatlantic flight to lhr from phl a well a the lhr to txl flight absolutely starving a very sad state of affair for ba,negative
what on earth ha happened to british airway inflight meal on our way out to rome we were told that the plane had to be changed so when we were only offered a stone cold croissant with cheddar cheese in it i thought well ok maybe the reason for that is because of the change of plane so no hot meal available however on our return not only did we have an hour delay still not sure why that happened we were traveling with a year old baby so it wa quite stressful just waiting around but on our flight our meal wa half a sandwich with a bit of bacon and lettuce they said chicken wa in it but i didn t have any in mine that wa it no hot drink either the drink trolley did come round once so we were then offered a soft drink or there were small spirit if you wanted them but the food wa appalling i m not a fussy person but i thought a meal on the plane consisted of something hot i didn t have time to eat anything at the airport and arrived home at midnight i wa starving,negative
travelled on august th when there wa a power outage at london heathrow which resulted in missing baggage the way ba handled is pathetic with no proper communication regarding status of bag i called several time and had to go to the airport twice there wa much confusion with the ba people claiming of the tag issued were not found in their system so no claim wa made for these missing bag no follow up though i wa promised they will call me later that day on the th finally the bag arrived on the th but the whole experience left me not wanting to travel with ba again,negative
flying out on sunday received call from ba saying they are changing aircraft from a to b so were asking passenger if they could fly out earlier i couldn t and there wa no pressure to do so by the friendly agent check in at dulles smooth lounge surprisingly very nice much above your usual state side and opposite ba gate aircraft b full flight probably around business class passenger so too many to know by name and no effort wa made by cabin crew seat cramped a expected did not eat on board a had dined in the lounge a few drink part of a film then tried to get some sleep on the hour flight landed earlier then expected but then had to wait half hour for luggage overall cabin crew very good aircraft clean nowadays if i fly first with ba i expect business and if i fly business i expect economy plus that way i m not disappointed,positive
where shall i start hour delay or the day without my luggage i came to nassau for my wedding me my wife and our best friend we arrived to nassau on tuesday with hour delay but the most annoying part just begun our wedding wa on friday me and my wife were without luggage until thursday due to hell know what wa going on in ba my best mate didn t receive his luggage for a week and on my wedding he wa best man so i had to give him cloth to wear we had to change the organized wedding date to another day later he received his luggage on a last day of his staying in nassau from the first day arrival ba wa contacting u and saying same thing the luggage is coming next day and that wa for me day my friend week when i received my bag they lost my key that i gave in airport in nassau to ba person i signed the contract that i agree when my luggage arrive they can open it and check it they lost my key and i had to cut my bag to eventually get my cloth the plane wa old but pretty well maintained me and my wife slept half flight but when we woke up the cabin crew told u that we can t have warm food anymore we had hour to fly and we were hungry ba you almost ruined my wedding you ruined all my friend staying he received his bag on a last day vacation all ba flight to nassau that week were all delayed from to hour never ever again,positive
this wa my first time on a long haul flight with british airway i found the seat to be very comfortable until a woman in front pushed her seat right back so then the video screen wa almost in my face she refused to put it back when we asked politely she got out of her seat and stood on my foot which had been recovering from a broken bone then laughed with her friend i detected she could cause trouble so decided it wa time to move i explained to the air hostess who immediately accommodated u she came back a few minute later to ask if i would like tea and if all wa ok she also brought a colleague with her i found the staff to be ultra helpful and pleasant the food wa good quality for economy previously i would have flown air canada but i think british airway are a better quality airline i would have no hesitation in recommending british airway,positive
i fly for pleasure and often take advantage of avios reward flight coupled with ba amex companion offer and with careful planning we seem to always find something in business for my wife and i and then pay for our yr old boy which given his age ha to include the half term and summer holiday period my best experience recently wa flying the to la vega on an ageing b but this wa overcome by the decision to offer u the option of sitting in the old first cabin which my wife and i took full advantage of and wa very comfortable quiet and private we did the same on the way back but because of an aircraft change we found ourselves flying in a refurbished new first which wa the icing on the cake all of this for just each in the ba sale this type of service can also be repeated on short haul with excellent food for an airline my only gripe are the use of tiny a s on the paphos route which is too small a plane for such a long route and i m not a big fan of the decision to reduce legroom in the new club europe however the exclusion of the middle seat doe give enough room for you leg having flown with qantas and emirate in y class recently i genuinely don t believe they are much further ahead of ba my a experience on qantas wa distinctly ordinary for a premium product,positive
staff wa helpful in both city the plane wa on the older side but clean the tv s were not the biggest but a wide selection of movie tv show and music the seat were comfortable and a good amount of legroom the service wa great and flight attendant attentive food wa good,positive
very poor flight broken seat toilet stuck together with tape and everything rattled around like an old car the inflight entertainment wa terrible screen tiny and very poor quality staff pretended to be interested and made glib promise about refund and upgrade for the way home which turned out to be a pack of lie i guess it wa get them off the plane and i will not see them again my various email to ba were met with a standard letter and an offer of a pound refund an insult considering the thousand paid for the air fare,negative
bologna london wa in economy class they gave u a sandwich flight attendant not super polite and not unpolite doing their job london to montreal i wa in businness class and liked the seat one flight attendant wa italian and she wa informed that me and my collegue are italian she gave u a warm welcome and took good care of u during the flight the amenity weren t amazing just small lotion sleeping mask sock and pen the food wasn t what you expect from a businness class it looked like the same a they serve in economy class,positive
this is a very mediocre business class product and definitely not up to the standard of other airline the seat are tight with no storage space for even a bottle of water and the configuration is poor i had k a i wa told it is the best seat in the cabin back corner rear facing but very private forget any meal choice being at the back mean you get what you are given wine were ok but the food wa ordinary the crew were probably the best part of the whole experience but they are nowhere near the standard set by qantas crew you can do far better with qantas emirate or cathay forget travelling with ba a it s just not worth it,positive
i wa booked in first class a a paying passenger on this airline but went to check in and wa told they had oversold the flight i wa bumped onto a qantas flight leaving half an hour later via dubai which may have been a blessing in disguise a qantas wa outstanding see my seperate review i chose the flight with ba via singapore for timing reason for sleep and for the use of the first class arrival lounge at heathrow a i had a flight onto berlin several hour later by going via dubai it threw my sleep out and no arrival lounge to use i had to change terminal and beg my way into a standard ba lounge which wa no mean feat what really annoyed me about this wa ba s attitude to the whole thing firstly i am of the opinion that no plane should be oversold least of all first class i wa after some compensation for the inconvenience they caused and eventually they offered me a voucher after week of back and forth email i had a business class return ticket to sydney and wa after an upgrade a compensation not unreasonable otherwise i wouldn t have asked for it the whole experience of dealing with ba in regard to this wa awful for a fare paying first class passenger to be bumped off a flight and be treated so disrespectfully after the event is a poor reflection on their level of professionalism i will not be travelling with this airline again,negative
another excellent experience with ba very fast check in at glasgow for exec club status holder prioritised over a large queue and the quickest security i ve had at an airport though small the ba lounge at glasgow is smart well designed and well stocked welcomed by friendly staff good selection of sandwich cheese snack and alcohol and happily provided a glass of champagne on request loved the little whisky nook priority boarding wa honoured and had row seating on this former bmi a good welcome by staff and adequate legroom first officer wa informative and we took off ahead of schedule for a hour flight the crew provided a good service of snack crisp and biscuit and a full bar excluding champagne no ce service on domestic route seat and toilet were clean and we landed ahead of schedule my only gripe wa that we taxied at an international gate and had to wait to be bussed to the domestic area but this wa only minute in total and staff were helpful throughout overall an excellent experience and a a silver card holder my loyalty to ba remains intact,positive
flew ba club europe from lhr ist in late june i m fond of the aging s used on this route although they ve seen better day and there is some wear and tear i prefer these older seat to the new ce seat a they re deeper with better legroom and padding t south lounge busy for a morning departure but staff were visible and food wine well stocked champagne delivered promptly and courteously priority boarding honoured and selected row centre bulkhead seat although slightly narrower these were comfortable and the extra legroom is a bonus team of serving a full ce cabin and csd wa excellent addressed by name magazine offered etc no menu distributed outbound which wa unusual but blanket and headphone provided at seat food choice were typical ce offering beef cheek or chicken curry but enjoyable nonetheless drink plentiful and free flowing flight made good time and kept informed by friendly captain throughout priority luggage and fast track security we re honoured and overall this wa another excellent experience with ba,positive
gla lgw fine for a domestic flight small snack and drink crew pleasant enough but arrival process at gatwick wa irritating my next flight from lhr so after a rather fraught journey across london i checked in at terminal and had to wait while check in assistant called several number trying to get a visa check performed by a member of staff who came to the desk to check my documentation the flight to moscow began with a long bus journey longer than the one already endured at gatwick around heathrow tarmac to the waiting aircraft the flight wa due to leave at and although the seat wa comfortable the aircraft wa extremely hot and stuffy for the duration of the flight the crew appeared impatient with passenger and quickly served a small sandwich and drink another drink run would have been appreciated a the heat in the cabin wa almost nauseating arrival in domodedovo airport at local time not ba s best effort but nothing seriously wrong,positive
bag drop at moscow domodedovo wa quick and efficient but no smile by ground handling agent this didn t bother me a she did confirm my bag would travel all the way to glasgow the aircraft wa too large for the small boarding lounge but plenty of shop and restaurant to pas the short time i had to wait i wa seated to the rear of the lower deck in a window seat where the aircraft narrow from seat to so i had a good amount of extra space beside and in front of my seat the crew were pleasant some appeared a little intimidated by some russian passenger when they were asking for drink or indicating their meal choice i noticed from their name badge that many of them spoke language in addition to english but i didn t see any who spoke russian after drink service the meal wa served including a vegetarian choice this wa in contrast to the outbound overnight flight in my other review the flight crew updated regularly i liked the use of the boeing on the route although internally it is beginning to appear dated at heathrow multiple boarding card passport and security check combine to produce an awkward process the flight to glasgow on an a the cabin crew gave an impression of efficiency and friendliness a short flight with time for a drink and small snack on arrival at glasgow i found a wheel missing from my wheeled trolley case rendering it unusable i mentioned this to the ground handling agent but she confirmed that unlike some of the low cost carrier ba do not take responsibility for such damage,positive
the staff were friendly and food wa good selection of film wa more than satisfactory however due to a power failure at heathrow our luggage did not make it on our flight i wa appalled to see that there wa no back up at all in the first place but then we were told our baggage would be with u within two day by one of british airway staff it is now nearly our fourth day on holiday and we still have not got our bag i understand that this happens and sometimes is inevitable but i am most dissatisfied by the information british airway are able to provide u about our bag all we know is that they have left heathrow we don t know which airport they were flown to if they arrived where they are or when we can expect them they have no detail of any individual bag and i think this is disgusting service the staff have been unhelpful and unwilling to aid u in finding our luggage which ha spoiled our holiday completely and left u in a dofficult situation with child under,negative
i selected british airway on this trip ahead of air china who i ve used a few time from beijing what a mistake because despite some of the problem with chinese airline they offer a far superior service to british airway the cabin seat etc were dirty and claustrophobic on this british airway flight and i bitterly regret my patriotism in selected them for this trip food is basically on a par with many asian airline economy class standard and you need to be very cautious about believing any of the marketing rubbish that british airway provide in different area this is not a premium experience and wa a true waste of money staff were on another planet a far a service wa concerned abrupt unsmiling and intent on getting service over a quickly a possible before they retired to gossip loudly in the galley using the call button wa a waste of time midflight i guess they were all resting by then i know that on air china the wine may be served rather warm a cold beer is hard to get and staff language skill are limited to standard phrase but their staff are cheerful enthusiastic to serve customer and their business seat a lot more comfortable the british airway motto of flying to serve should be challenged in court a a blatant misrepresentation luckily my company doesn t restrict me on airline choice and this will be my last trip on british airway who i first flew in the s when they were a truly great boac,positive
a pleasant trip with british airway a usual but suffered a minute delay for which the captain apologised for when we boarded inflight entertainment wa on mainscreen and showed a range of program and the onboard service wa good especially a it wa a jam packed flight however these plane are rather old and neither my seat nor the one next to me had a working headphone jack british airway is a standard airline but not a good a other major scheduled airline i find it tends to be rather hit and miss when it come to the quality of cabin crew and aircraft,positive
if brirish airway honestly think they are a premium quality airline they need a look at people like myself who have had one after another bad experience arrogance trading on past glory old cabin high price the list go on i booked a flight to florence through ba website received a british airway e ticket and only found out on the day when trying to check in that i wa flying with vueling never heard of them to cut a very long story short we were delayed hour nothing said to u and nothing offered at this stage at the gate when we finally got there one of the customer checked their website to find the flight had not left italy yet we informed the ground staff they did not day a thing after half an hour trying to get answer from them we were told we would have to wait till the next flight arrived how long we couldn t be told and they would then fly u to a different airport hour away and arrange a bus transfer i headed straight back the the terminal and sought a british airway rep to try and get an answer firstly because that is who i booked my ticket through and secondly a vueling have no representation at the airport i wa told it had nothing to do with british airway and they couldn t help i explained the situation again and asked to speak to a supervisor i wa denied that right i by chance saw a customer service representative walking past minute later and asked to speak to him he looked at me a if i had head and in the end walked away after calling me an ar le true in the middle of gatwick north terminal my wife and week old child were themselves waiting at florence hour for me we were told vueling were going to try and get u out the following day but no guarantee i booked another flight with british airway to get to my family and british airway have offered nothing not even an apology vueling will refund our flight if we go through the correct procedure british airway should be ashamed of what they have become,negative
british airway short haul economy product is fine especially if the flight time is only minute in the air british airway staff are friendly and professional but why ha there been such a drastic fall in standard they try to save money by not serving you napkin with the drink and the drink come in plastic cup that could have been more stylish little thing like these tell a lot about an airline but at least drink and snack were free,positive
british airway charged me for a too large carry on leaving my destination even though i used the same carry on traveling to my destination without charge and have never been charged for this carry on it fit into the carry on size check in front of his eye but he continued to tell me that it wa too big and i needed to be charged i had to call and email multiple time to get this investigated and which point they told me that day your carry on wa too large and you needed to pay the fine no refund will never fly with this company again,negative
from the lack of customer service both in their call centre and from their cabin crew through to not being seated next to my husband on a hour flight i am thoroughly disappointed with british airway my husband and i travelled on separate booking and were flying back from london to sydney together i phoned british airway day before my flight from london to ask them to link our booking number so we would be seated on the flight together i wa informed they could link the number but not guarantee we would be seated next to each other however if i wanted to buy my seat in advance then this would be guaranteed i wa not giving this money grabbing airline another opportunity to take more money from me so i refused this option my husband tweeted the airline and received two more reply stating they could not help with this when online check in opened my husband and i were allocated seat row apart and could not change this phoning the call centre resulted in being told the check in staff could assist arriving at heathrow the check in staff informed u there wa nothing they could do but ask at the gate the staff at the gate told u they could do nothing and had already told another family they would not be seated together the only person who offered any form of assistance wa a wonderful staff member at changi airport on the transfer desk when we stopped who managed to seat me across the aisle from my husband from the singapore sydney leg this woman did not even work for british airway but wa the most helpful not one british airway staff member apologised for this the cabin crew on both flight clearly did not enjoy working in economy a request for alternative food wa ignored repeatedly and staff were outright rude to passenger who asked for a landing card towards the end of the flight i wa told to go get it myself at the back of the plane i will only be flying with emirate or singapore airline in the future who know how to look after their passenger,negative
i am a silver card holder work in aviation and fly around time a week up to month ago i wa loyal to ba a it is an english airline with english value but this loyalty wa unfounded my main issue now with ba is the age and quality of the aircraft they are now flying on frequent trip to dubai with ba on a year old it seems that ba ha removed all cabin quality standard and is waiting to send the aircraft to the graveyard the seat were old and falling apart not one thing on this aircraft worked correctly the arm rest were damaged and the cushion flattened the inflight entertainment wa shambolic the screen did not work correctly and were in need of either overhaul or an upgrade about year ago on short haul flight in business lhr mun the upgraded cabin is a bit of a con the seat are lightweight uncomfortable seat foam with less leg room the faux leather is horrible to sit on and doe not let you breath especially when you are sitting on the aircraft without ac on my worst experience wa trying to fly back to munich from london it wa an old a a we took off the pilot had to do an emergency landing on landing they say that they were trying to fix the problem and kept u on board this i feel wa a lie a it so happened that they let the passenger off a the last flight to london departed we then had to stand around for hour trying to get rescheduled onto the next day flight and hotel accommodation which even though they knew we were coming had not prepared anything next day we flew home on the aircraft that we had originally taken off in i would not recommend ba at present even the new a i flew on to la had so many fault and badly thought through i will miss the easy access of terminal and lounge that i earned through loyalty a many other customer do however the age quality of the aircraft along with the new bullish attitude of customer care ha lost me a a customer,negative
i am a regular user of ba and generally find the airline to be ok but not outstanding this flight wa fairly full departed on time and check in wa very quick in my opinion the fleet of ba need either replacement of extensive refurbishment these aircraft are all old and look it in the interior the seat were past their prime and quite uncomfortable the food offering wa very poor no fresh item either at dinner or for breakfast staff were ok punctuality wa good and baggage delivery although not fast wa acceptable inflight entertainment wa good but the tv screen are from a previous age with quite poor quality,negative
the flight left on time and arrived early which wa great the b fleet of ba need either replacement or complete refit of the interior the aircraft wa old and looked it the food wa pretty standard but compared with our earlier cape town to london flight much better and more complete why the lack of consistency is unclear the inflight entertainment offering is good but the tv screen are small and worn delivering poor quality image staff were excellent efficient and friendly and went out of their way to make the journey more pleasant,positive
the outgoing flight wa fine the return flight wa cancelled due to an issue with the plane i understand this happen a i am a seasoned traveller however what happened next wa unacceptable and what you would expect from a low class airline we were handed ticket for an american airline flight from a different o hare terminal and told you have to go now the terminal wa in chaos and travelling from the international terminal to terminal three took one hour getting boarding pass and going again through security wa another hour or so but the flight wa delayed and left two hour late flight wa very mediocre and not what i had paid for with ba we arrived in london and guess what no bag even though we spent more than hour in chicago airport and were assured our bag were on the flight that wa sunday now it is tuesday no on ha contacted u and no update,negative
the seat that i had booked hour in advance a window seat had been changed without my consent to the middle of the cabin i complained to the staff at the gate and they said there wa nothing they could do about it a the flight wa full once onboard i discoverd that the interior wa worn and the seat very uncomfortable the in flight entertainment or the vod video on demand system apeared to be vhs and wa broken for my seat one of the cabin crew had to do a reset it which took over ten minute the screen wa very pixelated and the sound did not work very well which meant that watching the in flight entertainment wa more tiring than not watching it the food wa average but seemed to match the aircraft a it wa dull and tasteless a this wa an overnight flight i expected to be able to get somewhat more than a min nap which wa interupted any sleep wa not possible due to the fact that there wa infant in the world traveller cabin all of which at least were shrieking at any given time the boeing should not be still used on long haul flight a it doe not live up to the standard of ba s airbus a s or boeing flight i had an excellent flight out on ba and an amazing stay in washington d c but the flight back put a dent in the enjoyment of the holiday,positive
ba shorthaul business class is now nothing more than a con the seat is the same size a in economy barely inch seat pitch so no extra legroom for the extra money being paid the middle seat is blocked but they then go and stick a table in it making it not only hard to get in and out of the window seat but also no thought to emergency evacuation situation a it is alomst impossible to collapse the seat down it took fa when i asked them and almost minute why doe ba put these awful table in nobody us them and when i complained to ba i wa told don t sit in a window seat what sort of customer relation is that never again ba business class shorthaul for me i have flown many year with them including holding a ff gold card for year and numerous silver card a i said at the beginning nothing more than a con,negative
what ha happened to ba in recent year it ha been a long time since i ventured onto their long haul flight and after this trip i will steer very clear again and stay with cathay pacific and japan airline airport service in narita is always good because it is not ba providing the service but for the rest of the trip simply awful the seat that were introduced back in the era of the only ba bos to improve thing are cramped claustrophobic and very unpleasant on a long haul flight because of the seat design there is an economy class meal style service rather than the table service that most of the good airline now offer in business class the cabin staff were frankly laughable sadly with the exception of a charming and attentive japanese fa british airway is trading off a very distant reputation and it seems that most british customer select them simply because they are british anyone that travel a reasonable amount will know that ba is now well down the quality list and it is about time skytrax downgraded them to star airline maximum they do not meet star ba market itself a this slick british style when the reality is that they are a substandard member of oneworld now and should be avoided if you have a proper choice of airline many uk company and uk department stipulate ba a a no choice and frankly they are throwing their money down the pan if you re proud to be british i would recommend you give ba a wake up call and avoid this very poor airline until they wake up and improve standard a a closing point i recently travelled china southern airline on my outbound sector to guangzhou and they are street ahead of ba in almost every element excepting some language skill,positive
after flight change we took off to lhr which i wa pleased about given that so many of the shuttle our friend have tried to travel on have previously just been cancelled the aircraft from lhr had seen better day and i did wonder if we were in pe given other airline we had travelled with i would say categorically that it wa not worth the extra hike just book economy with extra leg room given we used ba s partner airline aa which wa awful and given the chap next to me had his family flight to canada cancelled by ba and had to go a day early via ny i would never book with ba staff on board were excellent,positive
considering ba s fare were high to begin with and you had to purchase your seat to secure in advance we still booked on the advice of our british son in law plane is so large take a long time to board and disembark we flew premium economy seat are bigger and have leg room but they re not comfortable for some reason flight crew wa fine and professional inflight entertainment wa fine but new movie selection wa small cabin and seat were clean and neat inflight kit consisted of sock ear plug mask pen and tiny toothpaste and brush they offer pillow and blanket but although the seat are wider they weren t easy to get in and out of and not just u a number of passenger contorted just to get out the meal were fine though served on a tiny tray loaded with food the meal wa pretty good not a lot of choice to london beef or pasta from london back to la it wa beef or fish it wa hot and there wa a lot of food a salad small cheese and cracker roll butter and dessert but i m not sure i d say it wa what ba s advertisement claim it didn t feel it wa a premium meal they also served snack but it wa flashed on the overhead with no explanation of where to go to get the snack the entire plane wa dark the second meal wa a breakfast but not especially appealing on the return to la it wa a very odd casserole rather dry and bland the flight wa smooth and arrived on time coming back we were an hour late waiting a the pilot informed u of sixty passenger arriving late from germany they lost one of our suitcase enroute we arrived on thursday afternoon the bag wa delivered late friday night to our hotel no offer to help with expense of having to buy what wa needed until bag wa found not even an email or text we finally asked the hotel who said it arrived midnight friday we weren t notified by ba until saturday afternoon we ended up spending quite a lot buying shirt underwear and short to get by if we d known they had found the bag we wouldn t have spent the money poor communication on their part not an apology or sorry for the inconvenience i guess they figured we should be grateful we got the bag at all i doubt we d fly ba again sadly i d hoped for something special,positive
we flew business class to vienna on the terminal is a dismal place and the lounge reflected this there wa very poor food choice and everything wa tired including the staff the outward journey wa okay flight attendant wa pleasant i think the meal choice could be improved these ticket are not cheap however the return flight which wa in economy also not cheap wa not good at all the attitude of the staff wa really below par the food choice wa an iced bun and a chicken bacon bun seeing the choice i asked for the vegetarian option couscous with a few slice of pepper all of which were tasteless when asked would i like a drink i replied bloody mary i should have known better a this wa the attendant who having to do a live safety demo chewed and smirked the whole way through produced the drink without any w i asked if i could have some and then watched him add a good cm to the drink turning the tomato juice a dark brown ba need to remember we a the customer pay their wage,negative
the staff were great food wa pretty good their seating policy is a sham for that reason i d never fly with ba again i have issue with arthritis and they changed my aisle seat to a window seat at the last moment and i had to endure no room to move for most of our flight from london to sydney,positive
short trip to vienna in ba economy class from terminal new a cabin on the flight out look nice and fairly comfortable for a couple of hour other than the cheap highly processed cheese and ham croissant and a coffee you are given it is no different to a low cost airline staff service minimal they served breakfast and collected the leftover basically in the cabin twice during the entire hour and minute flight not even an additional beverage service i m sure if they were flogging the drink it would be different return a couple of day later older aircraft but clean same indifferent service similar processed carbs handed out in silence and drink this wasn t a cheap ticket over gbp i know ba are competing with low cost airline in europe but when are they going to realise they aren t a low cost airline a bit of chat from the staff and a couple of extra coffee would have made all difference to how i felt leaving those flight ba sadly seem to be falling behind the crowd,negative
british airway business class product ha not really changed over the last year and they are now far behind competition in seat comfort half of the passenger must still fly facing backwards and entertainment what once made ba a great airline wa the cabin crew who treated their passenger like guest unfortunately they are slowly retiring and replaced by younger employee who could care or less about high revenue passenger on this particular flight the cabin wa half full but the crew rushed the service to an extent i have never seen before the pre dinner drink were served and less than minute later i wa served the first course i did not even start the salad when the plate wa taken away and i wa presented with a beef fillet that wa totally overcooked ten minute later the tray were taken away and the light dimmed we did not see the crew again for the next hour and no water or juice were ever served unfortunately ba ha the only non stop flight between cape town and london but next time i will fly emirate via dubai even if that mean adding hour to the trip,positive
had a very unpleasant experience with ba this time they changed our family seat without warning first time flying with two baby booked the ticket and reserved two seat together sitting together with husband both baby are lap seat two day before the flight i called the ba service to make sure our seat and ticket are all fine and got a positive answer on the day of boarding found out out seat are moved apart for hour flight our family seat are arranged far apart after more than minute standing at the counter waiting for the coordination we could sit across the aisle when we get on the plane no food for my year old if we are not allowed to bring food onto the plane what do ba expect baby can eat no help from staff with any service when baby are cry and very restless we didn t get any help from ba staff when i flew with other airline flight attendant brought small toy to help distract and entertain baby ba forgot to unload out stroller when we landed,positive
this wa my return flight of my trip in the usa from europe to the usa we had an airbus a which wa modern and quite enjoyable to fly my return flight wa on a boeing the aircraft wa quite old with seat which weren t so comfortable but at least fully ok the flight wa good cabin crew were friendly sometimes absent in the cabin and not very happy when you asked them something the food wa ok not gastronomic but acceptable in an economy class we had delay of minute by landing so the flight were quite on time though that the longest delay wa due of an engine problem i recommend british airway even for short flight if you book early and fare not too high than for longer one one reason more is that connection in heathrow are easy when you have two ba flight transfer done in min,positive
i have flown in business class with ba on many occasion and found the service to be hit and miss if you get an indifferent crew which in my experience is not far off half the time they want you to eat your dinner a fast a possible go to sleep and not bother them any more once such a crew spot the blanket coming out they cease interest in you never check on you and leave you to ask for everything i have never had that experience in business class with other airline for example emirate eva or lan chile quite the opposite anyway ba were offering a special price to upgrade cash only to first on my vancouver heathrow flight i thought i d try it it wa a waste of money the first sign of trouble wa the fact that i wa not welcomed or addressed by name an absolute must i think then the male and they tend to be the worst on ba i am sorry to say flight attendant came round handing out menu a though we were in economy he just doled them out rather than hand them to and speak to each passenger in a personal manner the wine selection didn t seem so very much better than business class and when i asked a specific question flavour of champagne the flight attendant didn t know the answer i eat slowly and wa still on my main course lamb and rather dry when the dreaded time arrived for the blanket to make their appearance i thought oh no surely not in first well i wa wrong i wa left staring at my dirty plate and eventually had to summon the flight attendant and ask to see the menu for dessert after that unbelievably i wa abandoned again and in protest got up from my seat and went off in search of a crew member i asked to speak to the cabin service director female delighful manner who wa full of apology of course and off i went back to my seat when i wa finally given coffee the flight attendant who brought it another female confided that ba don t have the staff number to pay the same attention to first or business passenger that some other airline do i couldn t believe my ear a for the cabin being in the nose of the i felt cramped the mood changing lighting doesn t compensate for the dark monotone blue of the seat and carpet the in light entertainment wa to my surprise just the same a on the rest of the plane i know this read like a demolition job on ba but i have made no exaggeration i really think willie walsh should don a false beard and shade and take a decent number of flight in business and first on his own plane he d find out for himself i want ba to be the best and it simply isn t lastly my experience of the hit and miss service of ba business class is shared by every other person i have ever mentioned it to if you re flying ba stay in business class you re not missing anything,positive
this review is written due to what i feel is true reflection of the decline of a once great airline check in took minute a the agent wa dealing with a couple and escorted them to the lounge and made u wait until he returned the first class security lane wa manned by the rudest staff i have ever come across the lounge wa fine but it is looking tired service good and range of menu wa broad and wine good no priority boarding had to queue in the airbridge for minute no greeting at the door no escort to seat no jacket hung up and the seat wa dirty covered in crumb and other such food opened two magazine both torn ripped and in rag order staff very pleasant professional and very helpful food ok not first class wine good the entertainment system wa broken and kept rebooting itself the seat would not lie flat and hard to move bought on board duty free and asked would i need a sealed bag to bring it through to my connection told yes deplaned no escort no gate to go to given wrong direction to the lounge had to clear immigration although not entering the uk waited minute to be told duty free i bought on board could not go through i would need to go to check in although told the opposite on board this wa done had to reclear security again got to the lounge asked for a shower told too busy connection flight wa delayed by one hour waited at the gate flight to dublin short salad served and tea priority bag were the last bag on the belt overall this is not first class it is not even premium economy i fly time a year and gold level ba you have lost your edge i will stay loyal to qatar emirate and cathay pacfic whose consistent hard wear and soft product is worth the money and deserves my business my advice do not waste your money with ba it s service cutting to the point of insult,positive
quick online check in and boarding pass with the ba mobile app it is so easy to use and definitely help you to get rid of those annoying loose bit of paper from your cabin bag manchester airport terminal is bursting at the seam during the summer holiday morning there s a severe lack of seat in this terminal but despite this the security check didn t take too long at all the ba ground staff at manchester seemed friendly enough and boarded strictly in group from the back of the aircraft to the front this help stop the queuing in the aisle onboard to get to your seat we were greeted at the aircraft door by a couple of cheerful and friendly crew the refreshed cabin now look very modern welcoming and clean the comfort of the new seat and the space on this aircraft a i feel would be more than sufficient for a flight of hour or so i m ft with a fully loaded cabin and a flight time to heathrow of just over minute the crew were quick into action we were offered a hot breakfast bacon wrap orange juice and tea or coffee perfect for such a short flight and definitely help set ba apart from the competition the flight arrived into terminal a few minute ahead of schedule and outside the uk arrival area less than ten minute later,positive
i am a very frequent long haul traveller and although i will often choose the asian carrier e g singapore airline jal cathay over british airway being based in london mean that i do often fly with ba i find ba s long haul business class offering though innovative when it wa launched in the s ha now been way outclassed by many of it competitor the seat don t quite lie flat and it s not unusual to get a broken seat and half the passenger have to go backwards and climb over other passenger to get out i can t think of any other major airline that ha this any more in business class i am told by a ba contact that they considered changing the configuration for the a s but didn t in the end worst of all i find the onboard service incredibly inconsistent most often it s a little begrudging occasionally it is excellent and sometimes it is downright awful i wa particularly annoyed at my customer service experience on a flight from lhr to tokyo haneda when settling down in my seat i looked down to find a dirty napkin used earplug and toothpick and significant quantity of broken glass around my foot good job i hadn t taken my shoe off at this stage my husband flagged down a member of cabin crew who said she would come and clear it but didn t i flagged down the cabin service director who did bring a dustpan and brush and said he would report it upon my return i complained to ba after three week they deigned to reply but it wa on the line of our cabin are always cleaned to the highest standard we are sorry you didn t find this to your liking effectively implying that i wa making a fuss over nothing,negative
booked for our trip to uganda in feb we spent for return ticket had to pay an additional to reserve seat on the flight about day ago i received a text message not a call saying that our flight had been cancelled left u in the dark until i had to phone their number to get transferred to a delhi call centre when i wa told i could get a full refund they tried to only refund me for the flight and not the seat on this now non existant flight i had to phone back a further time to get through to someone that could understand that i did want my a well in a nutshell i will not book with british airway again,positive
flew club europe from istanbul to heathrow excellent flight with quick and easy boarding the service wa a always to a high standard with a good selection of choice for the evening meal entertainment wa ok for the flight nice touch being able to leave the plan first it can make all of the difference for the line at t,positive
flew club europe to istanul on boarding wa speedy and boarding completed quickly for an on time departure the flight wa excellent and the crew in club europe were a always providing excellent service and professional at all time although the is showing it age i still prefer this aircraft to the a s which also are used on this route on the at least the club europe seat are comfortable and offer plenty of leg room unlike the new club europe which is used on the a s which is in reality going back to the day of charter airline so come on british airway let go back to the old configuration where we have plenty of leg room in club europe and reduce the row of seat we do not want low cost airline look alikes otherwise we would fly them we choose ba because we are loyal to you so bring back your old standard once again,positive
ba seems to be losing it ability to run an airline i have had flight canclled in the last month of them while i wa at the gate every flight which doe operate is delayed staff attitude is appallimg they just don t seem to care i have no compensation my step daughter wa deinied boarding due to ba overbooking ba then messed up her rebooked flight and then lost her luggage no apology and no compensation should their slogan be not to fly not to serve,negative
previously a loyal ba customer i usually travel economy on shorthaul but i am with long leg and am very uncomfortable unless i can get exit row so on this flight i took advantage of a what i thought wa a reasonably priced club world ticket expecting the past inch seat pitch horrified to find on boarding that ba have reduced the seat pitch to inch exactly the same a in economy the presence of an empty middle seat and pathetic little table for your tablet computer is no compensation fortunately this wa a short flight but even so i wa extremely uncomfortable cabin staff and other passenger said there had been load of complaint but clearly ba don t care i sometimes go to cyprus and the thought of a hr flight in these cramped seat put me off totally the meal wa passable but a the flight took off a couple of minute before midday it wa classed a late breakfast and no wine wa served it is clear that ba are putting profit over customer service and i am amazed that anyone travel club europe later in the year i wa due to travel to south america via madrid in business class but have now cancelled and switched to another airline in future i will avoid ba shorthaul wherever possible,negative
booked a hand luggage only fare at short notice so it wa pricey allocated a decent seat but amazed at charge of to change it so didn t bother flight seemed to be full of family split up probably for the same reason a ripoff flight wa late usual excuse of late arrival from a previous flight flight deck crew affable food and drink good and free a bonus cabin attendant an older purser up front a bit patronising the two in economy were really going through the motion no eye contact and perfunctory service drink served in a hour flight for the last hour the two at the back were eating club europe meal which i saw them bring from the front this wa ba on july not great,positive
flew to london gatwick in business class seat were quite comfortable reminded me of sleeping in berth on sailboat food wa good and the staff were very nice and attentive we had a long layover at gatwick before flying easyjet to inverness couldn t use the ba lounge after our flight but understand that is not the case at heathrow don t know why we used reward to fly club world and enjoyed it we have flown ba long haul several time and they have earned our return business,positive
i had the misfortune to travel up to newcastle on a hand baggage only fare which for some reason doesn t entitle you to choose a seat i wa allocated seat a which had the tightest leg room i have experienced luckily it wa only a short min flight these fare aren t cheap and ba seem to be focussing more on extracting a much money a possible rather than providing a good service which is a real shame,positive
day trip to vienna used ba economy a their business class fare are a complete rip off on ba these day heathrow t departure experience is quite shoddy compared to t or main ba flight out of t service onboard the flight wa perfunctory at best and staff seem to perform to a script in some case portray the feeling that because they wear a ba uniform they think they are so excellent a sad fact is their standard are below several major european airline the purser csd or whichever grand title they give to cabin staff on outbound flight spent a lot of time giggling in the galley like a year old child and then proceeded to make the pa announcement in the campest and most disrespectful tone of voice again this seemed to be done for the amusement of his fellow t d s a a oneworld emerald not with ba i stick with oneworld member but austrian offer a much better service and quality standard than ba,positive
let me just start off by saying that i m an educator and i have the patience of a saint this being said after my first flight with ba when my luggage stayed in tampa and didn t make it to the uk until four day after i d arrived i stayed fairly calm mistake are made my flight had been canceled which seems like commonplace at ba and wa re booked after only three hour on the phone when i ventured to take my trip home i wa notified via text message that my flight had been canceled yet again after speaking to a calm man about my horrible experience thus far he informed me of a customer care number that i could call and complain about my flight let s remember i m a teacher and i also payed for this trip that s an entire month pay just so we all know i m meant to leave tomorrow and still have not received confirmation via email i cannot reach ba via telephone i ve not been given proper accommodation to resolve my dissatisfaction with ba needless to say i will never fly ba again,negative
the baggage check in took forever it wa min of standing in the queue the flight looked good and well maintained inflight entertainment wa good and updated to latest movie documentary talk show for that the seating space wa just about good enough be careful of the head set it can get in the way and snap the air conditioner wa not up to the mark so it wa warm in the cabin the inflight food wa extremely hot in short it wa burnt the answer from the flight crew when someone asked for a second helping of ml coke can is that they needed to keep stock for the return flight this wa the first time in yr of international travel of hearing this excuse,positive
flight wa decent have to say the seat wa rather cramp i m cm or foot sat at seat f inflight entertainment wa alright but do take note to always unplug the headset whenever you get out of your seat it damage easily if it get caught on something i had to change headset because of that because being in a aisle seat you have to get off when someone want to use the lavatory thus remember to unplug it if you intend to get up from your seat service wa alright i requested for eye shade and it came about hr later crew must have forgotten about my request i didn t pursue it a i thought i could just head to the back galley and request for them after my movie in term of food it wa appalling and greasy overall i will not say never again but given a choice i d look out for singapore airline first then the big gulf carrier for the right price i d do ba again otherwise there are better way to suffer than that cramped seat,negative
lhr to kul bag drop off took much longer than expected especially a we had already checked and printed our boarding pass full plane left about min late food and drink better than expected a wa cabin crew service and seat comfort friendly and efficient service i suspect the plane might have seen better day given that the entertainment system wa ancient no game small screen compared with the like of singapore airline emirate etc some cost cutting evident no menu hot towel metal cutlery which is fine by me would be happy to fly with them again,positive
both flight on time aircraft appeared to be well maintained ba should be commended for retaining abreat seating in the legroom is adequate and adjustable headrest is a nice touch avod wa decent with clear screen though movie selection wa not extensive catering wa marginal on the outbound flight from atlanta with breakfast croissant being inedible however much better on the inbound flight from london cabin crew were professional but utterly aloof interacting with the passenger without the slightest hint of warmth not allowing seat selection until hour prior to the flight without paying extra is a negative in my opinion,positive
outbound flight to athens wa on time but return flight delayed by almost hour due to an equipment change the return wa on a b and i wa seated in the premium economy cabin which wa definitely more comfortable and had the added benefit of avod which is unavailable in the usual a i wa pleasantly surprised to be served a warm meal on both sector which is more than i wa expecting on an intra european flight crew were professional but not particularly helpful or engaging,positive
flew to london gatwick in business class seat were quite comfortable reminded me of sleeping in berth on sailboat food wa very good and the service staff were all very nice and attentive we had a long layover at gatwick before flying easyjet to inverness couldn t use the ba lounge after our flight but understand that is not the case at heathrow don t know why we used reward to fly club world and really enjoyed we have flown ba long haul several time and they have earned our return business,positive
i might have been in economy for service food and seating abreast no room to move if you are over kg or you re squashed completely wc clean with paper towel adequate ife the difference between older crew on prior sector and young cabin crew on this flight wa stark they were polite and totally wooden on past sector the older crew took the time to know you and a a frequent flyer even say thanks for choosing ba hung clothes returned crushed the dinner wa the same a jet airway domestic economy breakfast at a bit of fruit tepid tea pastry and egg roll served out of alfoil club world is like a stretched economy with a business class fare,positive
concord lounge wa more business class then first boarding smooth aircraft clean didn t like the seat much b the seat is closer to the window then the a which is more preferable for me crew professional no wifi just repeat that no wifi food selection limited a they had a catering issue if i booked and paid for first class i shouldn t have to hear they had a catering issue i had the sampler selection without the wine coupling the portion were small so had to ask for more food from a la carte overall the food wa not fantastic saving grace ha to be ba cabin crew very polite and attentive,negative
having read many review on here i wa somewhat sceptical about flying club world with ba however i wa pleasantly surprised by the comfort service and overall experience that we enjoyed on this hour flight to kuala lumpur we had front row seat a and b a window seat is reverse facing and b is an aisle forward facing seat the seat were very comfortable and we got a solid hour sleep we were concerned that seat b would get disturbance from the galley and washroom which were in front of it however this wa not the case and would recommend this seat it also ha no one stepping over you to get out of their seat seat a give good privacy if needed by raising the divider but you do have to step over the leg of the person in seat b to get out not a huge problem but sometimes difficult when dark very attentive and cheery cabin crew they maintained this good level of service for the full hour flight the food wa just about acceptable champagne wa offered pre take off and during flight wine selection ok i would be happy to travel ba club world again on this aircraft in seat ab or jk but i do prefer the upper deck on the sad will be the day they retire the good old jumbo i m not a lover of the new a,positive
lhr bkk lhr started badly with all the ryanairesque baggage warning at terminal ba s low kg baggage allowance had me nervy seating offered less legroom than competitor and seat not very comfy outward food superb best economy meal i ve had in a long time return trip horrible at check in i wa under kg but over the kg derisory ba limit wa asked for more but declined when i quoted thai airway kg limit i wa invited to buy a ticket with them so i had to put on load of clothes and dump a few cheap item to get my boarding pas on the plane i had to sit next to a very fat man not ba fault and the food wa disgusting some rubber chicken with four strip of gravy sodden potato wedge no vegetable second meal only accompanied by tasteless square of sponge no salad yoghurt or other goody between the meal a goody box wa given out with an oat bar and a few other bit which wa nice ife had the smallest screen i have ever seen and a poor choice of film return flight journey progress constantly broke down generally a poor experience considering ba s price will not be using ba again,negative
lhr ncl lhr economy on newly refitted airbus narrowbody the seat have so little legroom it ha the feeling of a budget airline far from budget price but ok for a short flight the problem is this seat configuration is used throughout europe and it s possible to be in such cramped condition for a longer flight upgrading to business isn t a solution a there s no extra legroom on these plane have flown both swiss and norwegian in the past few week a well both had more legroom would recommend norwegian great airline cheap comfy free wifi but not swiss dreadful customer service ba cabin staff continue to be very mixed some attentive polite and helpful others are downright rude a one wa on this flight overall ba can be great but sometimes not so much,positive
recently flew ba from lhr to ord a upper deck in club world excellent experience with great service and a good food selection too the crew were professional and very attentive but the ration of crew to passenger hel a there are only seat on the upper deck with two dedicated crew the seat wa comfortable with plenty of room and storage under the window wa a great help too the inflight entertainment wa ok but the selection wa very limited compared to what it used to be ba could do more to add a much wider variety to it film selection otherwise a great flight,positive
flew first class a from chicago to london easy boarding and excellent service provided at all time by the cabin crew in first class the food wa excellent and a good selection available too breakfast wa good with a nice selection with plenty of organge juice and tea which came in a pot which wa a lovely touch if you are flying british airway and connecting from an american airline domestic flight do note that you can now transfer from t to t at chicago airside by shuttle bus which run every min thus avoiding the security line in t this applies only to ba passenger tranferring from an american airline or american eagle flight to a british airway flight,positive
i wa amazed that this airline charge extra to book a seat in advance i have never seen that on any of the non discount carrier especially in business class when i pay for a business seat i expect that seat section will be free and i won t be charged for another the b class is not uncomfortable just configured weirdly with little storage space near the seat the fa have to constantly lean over the person in the aisle to get to the person at the window which is annoying and probably make extra work for them the food wa flat out lousy it looked like bad microwave fare the service wa ok nothing special although i wasn t going to watch any in flight entertainment i did check it out pretty meager selection if given a choice i don t think i will fly ba after this trip is over,positive
first leg cai lhr wa on time flight crew wa pleasant but the seating wa very cramped and legroom almost non existent the second leg lhr jfk wasn t much different with helpful crew but horrible seating space my knee were pressed against the seat in front of me constantly and had to relieve them one at a time it used to be a flagship carrier but now it s not much better than a budget airline will do my best to avoid,positive
travelled in party of four with prebooked seating abreast outbound abreast inbound cabin clean well presented and tidy with good welcome not a full flight but approx loading the level of service from cabin staff wa excellent service got underway quickly with full choice of menu and drink available good clear and short information from flight deck toilet were clean and tidy throughout flight light dimmed two and a half hour into flight to allow rest with water round taking place by cabin crew good english breakfast served hour out of jnb return flight good with attentive cabin staff and quiet cabin enabling some sleep food did not seem to be of such a good standard on this leg ba on these flight provided excellent service and we were impressed tv screen a little too small,positive
ba is getting more like a budget airline every time i fly i now have to pay to choose a seat when i book in and then wait an unreasonable time to board fast track were called forward first and about of the passenger went that way when i finally got to the front i asked if all the fast track were fast track and wa told no but we are not allowed to make them go to the general boarding queue so what is the point easyjet and norwegian are far better than ba for short haul and any middle east airline for long haul try harder ba please,positive
flight on time nice crew on the plane very comfortable seat and great food snack and beverage served during my hour flight the entertainment system screen wa big but with not a lot of tv show and movie everything wa perfect even the arrival wa great,positive
the booking of our flight wa straightforward however when we have paid to sit next to each other and paid for the opportunity to book seat in advance you would expect the seating plan for the aircraft to clearly show where all the toilet and galley are so that a the paying customer we would have a choice a to whether to is near them particularly on a long haul flight on this occasion british airway failed miserably the plane wa new and the seat were comfortable and spacious enough not the upper deck in ecconomy however being seated next to the toilet wa not the best location particularly a we had pre booked the seat online the service wa excellent and the staff helpful and happy to be there the gluten free meal that we ordered were provided although the breakfast could have been more substantial especially after an hour flight all in all a stress free journey which wa comfortable,positive
check in at first counter by a scruffy guy who wouldn t check my bag through on a connection the ground crew were ordinary on first check in nothing special and in the lounge unable to answer if there wa an arrival lounge at changi and just not interested in passenger sorry customer compared with comparable qantas product managed to get upstairs at the last minute on ba excellent cabin crew couldn t have been more different than on any other sector on this trip interesting and interested they couldn t understand the lack of through bag at singapore good food clean cabin uncomfortable and dated seat so didn t sleep much this cabin crew probably don t go on to sydney shame because they were excellent,positive
having encouraged passenger to check in online and save it staff time and money what doe ba do it reduces the number of staff for bag drop to the barest minimum business class bag drop at at heathrow had mostly empty desk and a queue resulting in a quite unacceptable wait of more than minute then having raced through security there wa the almost inevitable flight delay only this time the minute delay to the incoming aircraft wa a result we were told of someone forgetting to tow the plane on to the stand from another part of the airport with flight taking off to the west there wa yet another minute delay during taxiing only crisp or a couple of sweet biscuit were offered along with drink sadly the gap between the national airline and budget carrier just get closer all the time,negative
ba lgw dbv return ba dbv lgw baggage drop very fast at the ba check in then had to wait minute for the the express sercurity to open didnt open at am a stated the lounge at gatwick excellent good selection of food and drink priority boarding very good the flight out very good nothing wa too much trouble for the cabin crew on the return again fast check in then queued for minute to get through custom no fast check in once through went to the lounge ok but not a good a gatwick priority boarding poor at dubrovnik all put on a bus to be taken to the aircraft cabin crew not a freindly on the return journey both flight about on time the only complaint is the club europe seating you pay a lot more for theese seat but the legroom is the same a economy leg room come on ba put it back to inch a you are just giving more buisness to easyjet and ryanair,positive
overall the journey wa good the breakfast wa okay we were served sandwich which weren t that appetizing the cabin had recently been refurbished it wa very clean and new with mood lighting screen coming down from the ceiling provided u with a moving map overall a good flight,positive
if i could give it a zero i would from the moment we checked flight departure time and were incorrectly informed resulting in waiting to board for over hour to the incorrect arrival time a stated on the ife screen a hour flight with only main meal plus a snack served without any drink their idea of an asian vegetarian meal is grilled vegetable and rice drink only served when the staff were either not sleeping or chatting away very uncomfortable hard seat aisle so small that most passenger had their leg stuck out in the aisle and finally finishing with nearly an hour getting thru custom to then having to wait minute for my luggage can you please get off your backside ba and fly economy with singapore airline a they still realize it s human being they are transporting,negative
ba staff were excellent from the start to the finish service onboard wa friendly professional and helpful my wife left her handbag on board the plane when we arrived at heathrow and the ba flight attendant personally travelled from terminal to terminal to hand deliver it back to her if you know the huge distance between terminal and at heathrow you ll know just how much effort the flight attendant put in to returning the handbag that exceptional level of customer service is almost unheard of these day so ba get a customer care rating from my wife and i snack were good given it wa only a bit over hour flying time aircraft wa clean however the only negative wa the business class seat in fact the tiny cramped seat wa the only thing that ba should really change a it sort of killed an otherwise perfect journey they were standard economy class seat cramped in tight so your knee were pressing into the seat in front to convert these to business class seat all they did wa put a fancy clip in style armrest to make the row configuration seat instead of,positive
overall it wa good the flight attendant were friendly and helpful the seat were fairly comfortable with plenty of storage space on the side the food and entertainment were fine my husband s screen would not work at first but the flight attendant fixed it in a few minute the cabin wa clean one of the seat did have a broken piece of plastic where the cup holder wa it could have pinched or cut someone we were happy with the flight,positive
same tired plane back to london ground and cabin staff were friendly pleasant and helpful a first on this series of flight flew on the same plane on the way from lhr to ist see other recent review moved to row for more space still sub standard and why why put economy seat in business class lounge wa crammed and noisy pre flight i joined star alliance a a gold member so at least got to see the mile and smile lounge ba look around don t rest on last century s effort i ve flown ba first but just wouldn t any more responding to skytrax review may just help increase profit i must say apart from the cheery crew on ba the polite but totally disinterested service when it exists and old cramped cabin will be my memory of this business trip,positive
all i can say is mediocre having flown this route with other airline in business class i believe i have been spoilt the british airway product is old and just adequate tv screen small and poor quality food okay but nothing more seating poor the one highlight wa quality of service from the crew i had nothing to actually complain about but nothing to make me want to use this product again,positive
i have been flying between dublin and london once every week on average since the beginning of the year and i have regularly used british airway at the beginning however i have found their new policy of asking for for seat selection even at check in really annoying unnecessary and insulting to loyal customer fair enough if they want to charge for pre booking of seat but at least they should allow selection at check in time in line with their direct competitor on the same route aer lingus i have also found the service food drink etc extremely poor for the fare charged even for the short sector if they continue their money grabbing policy i will definitely and happily give more of my business to aer lingus and cityjet which operate the same route and seem to not treat their customer a infinite cash cow,positive
uncomfortable serviceless low class i had low expectation and they weren t met club world ha gone from leading to lagging cramped pod seat across when others have and a tired old plane i usually fly in an aisle seat but know better on ba so wa in a window seat the passenger next to me wa repeatedly woken a food wa handed over or spilt on him after the service the polite cabin crew disappeared only one bottle of water all flight the food wa tasteless overcooked and the presentation with fast food condiment reminded me of fast food chain at the price this is the worst product in the sky seat wa broken and ife clunky being used to cx qf sia finnair air tahiti nui aa lan chile and more i hesitate to call it business class because it isn t,negative
expected club world got club europe the same a economy on any decent airline food wa okay plied with alcohol if you wanted it must be the oldest aircraft in the fleet no ife other than a screen for the cabin wa told by the ground crew that my qualifying international cabin bag needed to be checked in not happy it s been on international and domestic roll aboard other than on a turboprop my colleague had the same officious and uncalled for exactly the same cabin bag were rolled aboard day later on the return flight seat were economy class and cramped with little recline and less pitch than economy on many airline why pay for club europe business class when you don t get it,negative
i managed to switch to upstairs on the so happy a it is a quiet space seat a footstool wa broken so the night wa uncomfortable we left singapore around midnight and got into lhr at hr so sleep wa intermittent a i tried to adjust the seat to compensate food out of singapore wa okay but still lacking one pleasant attendant one grumpy no fast track on landing because we got in early so queue with coach tour i m stuck on british airway this trip but won t be booking by choice again,positive

very good all business class flight only issue experienced wa the slow bag delivery upon arrival in jfk food exceptional and service provided wa good the seat were full flat ipad provided for inflight entertainment with several film tv show etc a good flight albeit a little expensive,positive
once british airway review their seating facility i will use the airline again the seat are so cramped and when the passenger in front decided to recline his seat that wa it no matter how much i asked him to recline back he would not do it only when the food arrived did he move his seat and to add insult to injury the food tasted vile and ended up eating the bread roll only i will use ba now a a last option,negative

i wa pleased to see that british airway now us proper gate at terminal heathrow compared to the previous bus boarding scrum the boarding wa organised the crew friendly and the onboard service good we were served a tasty ham and cheese croissant with drink the flight departed and arrived on time and bag arrived quickly the seat wasn t very comfortable but all in all very good,positive
this wa my first time with british airway i wa disappointed in the amount of seat leg room compared to some other airline i ve traveled with i wa also surprised that on longer european flight london to istanbul for example which i traveled there wa no tv when the flight is a long or longer than flight in asia from country to country which have tv entertainment system the universal entertainment system wa broken too and the sound wasn t working the service button to call an attendant wa broken too a stewardess on this particular flight from jfk to lhr ba on june wa so rude to my daughter my daughter is unable to eat dairy and both food option on the plane included dairy my daughter asked nicely if there wa any non dairy option and the stewardess take the food from my daughter s tray and say i guess you re just going to have to eat that salad it wasn t what she said that bothered me it wa the way she said it she didn t offer pretzel or non dairy snack or anything this wa my first experience with british airway and i wa disappointed it wasn t until my flight back home that i felt a bit better on my ride back with british airway not this flight in specific from lhr to la i encountered a steward who wa very pleasant polite and very professional,negative
a a frequent flyer on various airline british airway is by far the worst i have experienced substandard customer service even before the flight my original plan wa to fly from toronto to rome via london on july nd three ticket were purchased and confirmed in march two week before departure an email wa sent to me altering my flight from london to rome i called and waited on the service hotline i wa able to get myself on one flight and my parent on another the rep refused to try to put me together with my parent less than hour before departure my rescheduled flight wa rerouted to naples the agent told me all extra travel expense would be my own on the day of departure i got my flight from gatwick to rome after rushing from heathrow i wa told initially the flight wa rerouted to naples and just before departure this reverted back to a direct flight to rome very confusing communication i arrived in rome to discover my parent flight wa delayed for four hour with more ba flight arriving into the terminal the service desk wa closed before my flight even arrived there are no ba rep anywhere to seek assistance,negative
my family and i flew from rotterdam to london on th of june and it s our first time traveling with ba we chose it a we thought this airline would be better than budget airline with constant delay we were very wrong we arrived at the airport on time and sat down to wait ba announced flight delay due to technical error for hour before finally announcing that the flight wa cancelled we were given no explanation except for one phrase technical fault we were then unceremoniously sent back to queue in line to be rescheduled we waited another min and wa then transferred to a pm flight original wa pm we were denied all chance to board an earlier one at pm we did not complain or gave ba any trouble we followed procedure and applied for compensation online their reply wa simply a sorry and they denied all responsibility,negative
returning from chicago to berlin the overall flight experience wa no better than the outward sector a week earlier i opted to skip dinner and instead have breakfast since the flight landed around breakfast wa a hard slab of cake with one drink a total disgrace once again the cabin wa too warm and i saw no passenger using their blanket the berlin flight ex lhr wa delayed initially due to the usual late incoming aircraft excuse and then to a broken apu so no air wa being pumped in to the cabin and the engine could not be started for some reason it then took half an hour to locate one that did actually work meanwhile on one of the hottest day of the year we waited on board in increasingly sauna like condition the captain kept u informed and then made up a bit if time although we still landed minute late,negative
my experience chime with the general consensus on the club world service lhr jfk cabin seat and fitting are showing their age and look rather shabby by this point not too clean red wine spill on my foot rest when i boarded tiny screen and ife looked dated not great entertainment selection the food quality wa good but service from cabin crew wa rather indifferent with little attempt to make it a special dining experience nut and chocolate served in packet not bowl not attentive over providing drink refill or water i wasnt offered all of the item listed on the menu where did my fruit and cheese platter go had to ask for coffee tea refill after the meal brewed coffee only no fresh latte cappuccino wa not offered disgestifs after the meal cabin crew disappeared after the meal self service snack in the galley were economy quality apart from some nice rose champagne just not a luxury or experience felt like i wa in economy but with more space and food,positive
on this occasion my partner and i experienced a hour delay with ba there wa no communication at the airport nothing until we got onto the plane where the captain told u delay were due to a bag that had not been checked in correctly at heathrow because of the delay when the plane finally arrived it had no water on board and wa not permitted to fill up at our destination this meant disgusting toilet because of no flush and no warm drink on board we were sat on the runway for an hour because the engine would not start we had no aircon for min when we finally got back to heathrow the captain told u that he wa sorry for the issue,negative
boarding well organised and efficient seated in world traveller on the upper deck x x on this deck is preferable to the x x on the lower deck flight attendant welcome customer on board and service wa friendly and professional seat fairly comfortable legroom standard for economy ife excellent a huge range of entertainment option the disappointment wa lunch the chicken casserole wa basically a few piece of chicken swimming in oil with a few vegetable very poor afternoon tea on the other hand wa nice,positive
yul to fco and bcn to yul ptv on each for e long haul plane entertainment did the job and it wa activated when i boarded the aircraft the food wa ok except on the return flight from london to montreal where the chicken wa dry no flight delay on outbound journey but hour delay on the return flight where the aircraft ha to be changed due to the mechanical problem,negative
our night flight wa delayed by nearly an hour not the fault of the airline but a contributory factor to our disappointment with ba on this flight th june we paid extra for our premium economy ticket then extra again to reserve seat and past experience with ba and with equivalent seat service on virgin atlantic had led u to expect value for money and some small reward for the extra cost not this flight however where the only real benefit appeared to be a small amount of extra legroom we were last to board after first business and economy where customer in premium economy used to be greeted with the choice of a glass of fizz or orange juice now it is water or juice once we had taken off drink were served fine but when the steward came to collect the empty glass bottle he knocked the glass onto the floor where it broke the staff were all rushed and seemed to be short on number perhaps i wa made to feel that the breakage wa my fault dinner did not arrive until after pm by which time i had rather lost interest a had my partner so far our extra cost had bought u extra leg room and one glass of wine i wa not offered a second possibly because of my crime of causing the steward to break a glass overnight by contrast to other night flight the light were never fully dimmed there were no offer of water orange juice to prevent dehydration the promised on the menu card morning light snack and coffee tea fruit juice wa a hastily delivered piece of dried up cake and a weak coffee no mention of fruit juice i couldn t really see what my extra cost were getting me that those in economy had for less the extra leg room wa rather negated by the passenger in front s fully reclined seat i will not if at all possible be travelling with ba again it left a rather sour taste at the end of our holiday,positive
check in at tegel wa a disaster and ludicrously for it ha a lot of ba flight i wa told there are no ba staff at that airport to sort out problem minute prior to departure check in desk were open business economy a a ba silver card holder i joined the business queue first one lady had considerably too much baggage the argument went on for more than minute before she paid the extra fee then the technical crew for a pop event the previous day had to be checked in not only were some of their or so item very overweight others were way too large after more minute i asked a young lady why the other business passenger could not be processed at the economy desk this wa not possible i wa told eventually another economy desk opened yet our queue remained immobile for a further minute finally after more than minute someone decided we could be processed at an economy desk after all looking forward to a drink in the lounge i then discover there is no lounge airside a for the lhr ord flight i have been spoiled with business class intercontinental travel since business class wa introduced to board an international carrier and discover a seat pitch of just wa a major shock this is like travelling long haul on a budget carrier only at considerably greater cost the worst part wa the cabin wa kept at an extremely warm temperature throughout despite request for the captain to reduce it to a more reasonable level the meal wa ok and the ife had a decent selection of movie but overall the flight wa hugely uncomfortable with some other carrier still offering a seat pitch greater than ba ha lost my future business,negative
after my flight to vienna with ba i wa hoping for a slight improvement on the way back however the service wa very boring drink service wa rushed with the stewardess pouring an entire miniature of vodka into a drink before putting a drop of tomato juice in when i asked for a tomato and vodka unpalatable wa glad to be off the plane in all fairness hoping that one day ba will wow me,positive
slightly disappointing flight in an aircraft that wa showing it s age it seems very little effort is put into cabin decor meaning it look quite tawdry in all fairness food wa okay ham and cheese croissant but nothing to write home about seat weren t great for someone my height and all in all i wa left feeling underwhelmed budget level offering at a high price,positive
lhr fco and return outbound a new club europe seating return boeing i ve not flown club europe for some year and wasn t looking forward to the flight due to the new seat pitch which is the same a economy i wa fortunate on both journey to secure a seat in row where you do have extra legroom the only other seat with extra leg room is the emergency exit row the food and drink selection wa good and the service from the crew wa excellent on the return leg,positive
it appears ba continues to adopt a do a little a possible for this route presumably due to their monopoly the aircraft and cabin is looking tired old and decidedly mediocre compared to recent business class flight with emirate etihad and qatar airway outward excellent service from cabin and flight deck crew my seat k wa shockingly filthy it had been cleared since the last passenger but i noticed much ingrained filth e g food drink splatter on the cabin wall crumb in seat fold gap and stained cover all sort of debris on floor in gap crack and remarkably grimy carpet cabin attendant offered me choice of the empty seat but on inspection these were in a similarly grim state seat wa ok for comfort but mediocre ife choice with very poor quality screen meal service wa good for food and drink although dirty environment wa off putting lacto veg meal much improved since last tried pantry service is underwhelming in place e g mar bar and kitkats are tragically promoted a retro but some nice ice cream return in k and excellent service from cabin and flight deck crew i m ridiculously grateful that this cabin is clean tired so skipped dinner decided to watch a short tv programme and found much better picture quality on screen compared to outward although even less programme choice i found seat comfort mediocre in bed mode but got five hour of sleep the cabin layout is clearly designed to maximise passenger number without much thought for their comfort awake for breakfast so when attendant were offering bacon roll i asked for my wife and my requested lacto veg meal staff returned ashen faced and profusely apologising with two neatly wrapped and labelled plain white bread roll such bad service and a lack of joined up thinking you couldn t make it up post flight i found the ba customer complaint dept to be dreadful and left me far more disappointed with the service than at the end of my flight,positive
flight home wa a good a the flight out had long delay to depart in part from a missing passenger who checked in then disappeared one of those mystery about airline travel that happens from time to time meanwhile a full plane of passenger were delayed in total by min a wa newly refurbished and clean so called new club europe seat were installed and a i wa in row it wa okay the menu wa identical to the outbound and the beef main course wa wa terrific it wa the sort of meal that i would have happily paid for in a quality bistro fa were great the chinese fa wa the sort that understand customer service her colleague wa closer to retirement and seemed to be on another planet most of the time at the half way point i wanted another gin and tonic but they had run out of both ice and proper glass on arrival to lhr we were parked mile away from the terminal no reason wa given all in all a very good experience,positive
once boarded there wa a technical fault with air conditioning and the cabin got very hot the cabin crew did offer cold water to keep all passenger cool and delay wa only around minute once airborne drink and snack were served seating on a wa comfortable for a short flight at gla airport the parking stand are so far away from the main terminal and pick up point and change to the airport in the past couple of year have increased the walking distance this is annoying if you only have hand luggage and want a quick getaway especially on a late night arrival one see easyjet and ryanair passenger passing through the arrival process much quicker,positive
disappointed the food wa poor my wife s steak could have been anything my curry had a tiny piece of chicken the cabin wa less than half full but cabin crew hadn t time to bring a glass of wine after the meal staff disappeared no after dinner drink offered no refreshment during the night for the price this could have been a lot better return on old b wa better,negative
this is my rd flight with ba in month and the worst yet the customer service and communication is appalling originally my return flight wa from rome to london gatwick but my flight wa cancelled due to issue at rome airport but instead of ba getting in contact with me in regard to this the third party company i booked the flight with had to when checking in they tried to charge me for baggage again although already paid for when i spoke to them on the phone they just tried to fob me off to other number even though i called the customer service number this is a shame because for once the actual flight and flight service wa good which is surprising but a a result of the rudeness lack of communication and appalling customer service i m very unlikely to ever use them again,negative
british airway never fails to surprise i find the business lounge in geneva quite reasonable and on this last occasion wa impressed with the manner in which the lounge manager handled a cranky passenger who wa accusing him of destroying her favourite newspaper then once on board i discovered that business class on some of ba s european route have a seat pitch that almost prevents gaining entry to the window seat for those used to flying qantas domestic economy in australia think of a forward seat in economy with the middle seat kept empty and that s it on the other hand service and food wa excellent and the flight crew commentary wa superb ba have an excellent in flight magazine,positive
flight wa delayed hour i wa given reasonable notice but then had to rearrange my connecting flight and ended up with a lot more time at heathrow than i would have liked check in wa fine and cabin staff attentive food average but i do have an issue with space the fuselage taper at the back there s not enough room for seating and row on have configuration row don t have enough room for seating either but ba do it anyway by sneakily making the outer seat narrower than the rest i endured a hour night flight in one of these horrible seat my back wa twisted and sore for week after this is just not acceptable for a long haul flight especially at night ba charge extra for seat identified a having more room by the same principle these seat should be advertised a having less room and cash back offered for anyone prepared to accept them small child perhaps,negative
short hop from the empty terminal at lhr to lux nice to be able to use the lounge in lhr but an aggravating wait at security despite virtually no line excellent service on board off the plane at lux through passport control and in the car in under minute i wa impressed with the cheerful nature of cabin staff,positive
lhr ncl lhr i wa rather disappointed to learn that my early morning sunday flight wa cancelled without any reason on the afternoon before the morning i wa to fly the whole point of this trip wa so i could easily go back and return the same day to attend my sister wedding saving time and also money due to the train being so expensive i managed to rearrange my flight for the previous night and while annoyed i had to now arrange last minute accommodation i thought this would be straightforward and a far a re booking it wa via the ba app what it didn t tell me wa that the flight i re arranged to fly out with wa severely delayed and my heart sank a i received a a text app notification telling me so i think this wa very sneaky not to mention before re booking and i spent a couple of hour getting to know terminal the general feedback from here and from friend is flight on this particular domestic route are often subject to delay and cancellation and for a full service airline that is simply unacceptable more than anything when everything else is cutback reliability becomes golden the plane itself wa immaculately maintained and clean and i liked the simple but elegant cabin ba staff also do let thing down a bit often quite brusque and unfriendly and the desk staff do come across rather insincere when there are issue a there wa here cabin crew were fine but lack warmth of some other airline sadly there aren t any other option on this route so will probably be switching back to rail despite sometimes competitive fare,negative
lhr to santorini lounge wa busy but then it often is flight left about minute late and this wa blamed on congestion i guess we are stuck with this excuse for the next year until they build a rd runway plane wa very clean we were in club europe new seat design in row i am glad we were a row etc looked very cramped the only difference with economy being the table tray in the centre instead of a seat lunch wa very good indeed i had the thai chicken my wife had the cheek of beef which she said wa excellent fa were very friendly smooth flight all the way it sort of worth the extra money i guess the privacy and the one wc for the front end of the plane it could however be so much better with wider seat and doing away with the silly central table,positive
fantastic from the word go check in wa great concorde lounge great along with the spa elemi treatment which wa lovely good service and attention to detail crew onboard delightful food wa nice and wa a real pleasure,positive
after flying many many time i can honestly say this wa the worst plane i have ever flown in the aircraft wa old and falling apart during the flight the handle of the toilet flew off one of the overhead bin wa loose and the table holding the bassinette wa broken the carpet wa threadbear and the equipment wa being held together with tape they did not have enough food and nothing available for me i have a nut allergy the food that wa served wa not fit for human consumption the toilet were not cleaned during the whole flight hour and a a result the smell from there wa disgusting the rubbish bin wa overflowing with waste which included soiled nappy the only time we saw the cabin crew wa when they were serving food they looked very scruffy not what you would expect of a ba cabin crew all in all a very unpleasant flight i travel to asia every year and will ensure i never fly ba on this route again,negative
very good flight in club world from start to finish ok so the plane may be rather old but it wa in immaculate condition and the cabin crew older mostly british delivered efficient professional and friendly service the lie flat bed i took a rear facing window seat is excellent for sleeping and give great privacy the food offering wa not amazing some cost cutting here and i wa surprised to see nut served in bag not on dish there wa however a good selection of drink and glass were topped up a required inflight entertainment wa excellent with a great range of both movie and tv show i fly often with the middle eastern carrier who offer newer plane and a more luxury feel however ba scored highly on crew seat comfort and ease of sleeping i also visited the heathrow t arrival lounge which is first class i will definitely fly ba club world again if the price is competitive,positive
overall good experience ba owns vueling iberian airline booked me paris to rome if they try to book you on this airline say no no leg room no service never again after two week in europe i wa really looking forward to going home to my family when i finally got to the ba counter in the rome airport i wa told my flight to london wa delayed i would not be able to make my connection in london and i would have to spend the night and fly out in the morning at another ba desk i wa told they had a hotel for me within walking distance well i m and i would say more like walking distance if you re a camel the room and hotel were fine but when i went to the restaurant with my meal ticket i wa given a menu with three item on it told i could have water for free but be charged for any other drink i had paid extra to book my aisle seat month in advance but now i had to book again ba should have done this one day in advance of my flight middle seat for my hour of flight home to la,positive
lhr to bkk june th club world business while the aircraft is starting to show it age seat were reasonably comfortable a long a you don t mind the unusual seating configuration where some passenger travel facing backwards cabin service and food quality were good with one of the best breakfast we have had in the air a delicious fruit muesli followed by a full english which wa hot and tasty on this overnight flight sleep wa difficult mainly due to the narrowness of the seat ba should provide a mattress topper a many other airline offer to enhance sleep comfort fair value for money proposition,positive
ba there wa a delay which i understand and accept this crew were helpful and went out of their way for me and my travelling companion a we were due to make a very tight connection to travel home by other mean it wa unfortunate that my travelling companion s bag didn t make it on the outward journey particularly a our break wa only day long and we had pre booked travelling plan for the day after arrival,positive
i flew from seoul to london business class and wa surprised how much better the food wa than in first it wa interesting and enjoyable and attractively presented if only ba would abandon the bizarre seat configuration in business it would be very good the service wa ok if a bit inattentive but it is embarrassing to have the attendant slide down the screen every time you need anything you find your face inch away from that of a stranger fortunately i now know which seat to pick to avoid climbing over my neighbour to reach the aisle,positive
i flew out on the th june and all i can say is that the staff flight and service wa excellent we had a little issue with the flight a the people we booked it with made an error on our ticket but ba sorted this out in no time i will definitely be flying out with them again and i will recommend them service on the plane wa excellent,positive
i fly with this airline almost every other weekend from abu dhabi to muscat throughout i think so far trip with them they have never had any delay with me and even if there ha been it would be a maximum minute and still be able to arrive in muscat on time staff are professional yet friendly enough to chat to it would be excellent if there wa a flight from muscat to abu dhabi at an earlier time the only one available now is one that arrives at midnight the only downside to this airline is that the highlife shopping is not available for that abu dhabi muscat due to the short duration even if you booked and paid for the item online and were hoping for an onboard delivery,positive
ended up on a year old the second oldest in ba s fleet and boy did it show the cabin wa seriously dated and in need of a good renovation but i guess this aircraft will be retiring any day soon the outbound flight wa on a nicely retrofitted with comfortable spacious chair and excellent clear and larger ife screen the screen on this were tiny and and very poor resolution by comparison nevertheless the service wa usual good ba standard courteous and efficient with decent enough food better than in past year when revolting soggy pasta seemed to be the norm despite the ancient and not up to standard aircraft the flight wa pleasant enough,positive
we were boarded quickly but suffered a weather delay of over an hour because of localised thunderstorm throughout this time the cockpit crew kept passenger updated and after about min water juice were offered before being advised that we would soon be cleared to depart the cabin wa clean and the crew friendly and polite with apology about the delay breakfast snack just ok but only a short flight in my view ba in general do short haul well but really need to improve their long haul product,positive
terrible flight time is well over hour seating is like ryanair but we are talking ba club europe which genius decided that inch is sufficient for premium passenger no idea what to do with my leg it s impossible to use my laptop this is not business class very uncomfortable flight especially for the money i paid ba rethink,negative
th may lhr den b seat a paid extra for legroom seat which wa good though the width is very narrow lady in seat next to me kept fidgeting and her arm kept twitching into mine the whole flight which wa annoying flight wa on time and cabin crew were all very friendly food also wa pretty good for economy is really showing her age now though the cabin wa clean tidy and in good condition it wa old in style and very noisy the entertainment system is also quite long in the tooth with a small blurry screen pretty good flight though,positive
ord lhr club world seat b had booked a world traveler plus but wa upgraded pretty close to departure this meant i did not have any time to get a meal before hand and the meal on board wa both small and not very good would have been better with the economy mean i think breakfast wa pretty poor a well with several item not given out other than that the crew were excellent and very attentive the seat wa full lie flat though pretty narrow i thought compared to other carrier business class entertainment system wa also very good and up to date,positive
lhr gla a seat a wa able to choose this seat in advance which ha plenty of legroom a no seat in front flight wa pretty full cabin crew were all extremely friendly and helpful welcoming every passenger individually flight wa delayed by difficulty in storing the silly amount of carry on baggage people brought on board some stuff wa obviously way bigger than the allowed size it took age to get it all sorted which wa ridiculous however the crew kept smiling though it all again new configuration seating which i found pretty comfortable drink and snack wa served a usual landed nearly min late to discover my baggage had not made it from grr which wa quite annoying overall good flight though,positive
may gla lhr a new seating seat a flight wa on time and about half full i ve read complaint about the new seating however found it to be comfortable and roomy drink and snack service wa fine and the cabin crew were all very friendly,positive

this is more of a general review having travelled almost exclusively with ba longhaul a a family for the past year i highly rate ba for family on our travel i have found the ba staff inflight to be sympathetic towards my wife and i with having infant they have offered quiet area during service on the a to help settle our baby left u to last for dinner service if we were in the middle of settling the kid nothing worse that being made to take a tray of food when all you want is your kid to sleep friendly and attentive but maintaining professionalism crew are not servant to passenger they have a fairly strict roster of duty to attend to but i find that they are more than happy to help at the less peak time they are less inclined when they have people to feed it figure i am fortunate to regularly travel longhaul for business and so reach silver tier on an annual basis having bc check in is a great bonus for checking in a family shorter queue etc the greatest perk is that a silver i get bag at kg each not only that but when i travel with my family my wife and eldest child get the same allowance a i do and our infant get kg bag plus car seat and pram free that is a huge allowance and make packing less stressful ba are a professional outfit and get you where you are going i have no issue with them and find them value for money i could not care less what the food is like i fly to be on time and get good connection heathrow t is great,positive
lhr to yvr return hard earned avios point trip had been year since i last travelled club world and not much changed the lounge at heathrow wa very crowded afternoon tea time so just sandwich cake and soup available sandwich were fresh and very nice plane a a that had seen better time the seat wa clean but tired looking the biggest let down wa the screen that wa blurry in comparison to the bling airway screen i had in economy the main meal wa really nice beef fillet that wa tender and cooked side salad full of flavour and mediterranean starter that i wanted more of the nd meal wa afternoon tea of finger sandwich and a piece of chocolate rocky road a real cream tea would have been better seat comfortable upright and in sleeping position got plenty of rest and sleep both way coming back the lounge in vancouver is above the gate just enough seat nice snack another nice meal on board spoilt by a dry bread roll breakfast wa a big disappointment expecting a cooked english breakfast we got fruit in a plastic box followed by an egg and bacon muffin i took one bight of the muffin and it mad me want to gag good crew on both leg bag came out priority so big plus to ba a a free plus tax and surcharge trip it wa good but ba need to improve if they want to lead the pack instead of being just average,positive
club world from lhr ord busy flight on the ageing seat comfortable a always and a calm cabin on the upper deck only fault were the crew they seemed just out of training school although very pleasant and friendly the two made quite a few mistake with order and drink and appeared nervous flight left and landed on time an all together good experience,positive
this review refers to a return trip from india bom lhr in premium economy the seating is fine in this class and is definitely worth the extra from standard economy in term of the leg room however that s where it end the service compared with business which i travelled out in is woeful the ba cabin staff seem to treat anybody not flying in business or first a second class citizen and barely do their job that and the awful food the worst i ve had on a long haul flight ha made me seriously re think my choice of carrier next time i fly the route,negative
this review concern lhr bom in business class i m not a fan of the ba business class seating it s very awkward to access the aisle from a window seat and also the practice of having your meal passed over a retractable divider is difficult for both the customer and the flight attendant having said all that the service on board wa great the stewardess looking after my side of the cabin wa chatty friendly and couldn t do enough to help the seat itself is ok not overly comfortable but i did manage a few hour sleep food is not great on ba though,positive
family of out upper deck back fortunate to be a silver member so get to allocate seat when booking flight on time out hour delay on return reason late inbound aircraft really useless excuse on departure no knowledge of which gate would be used for this and many other flight so both main lounge by security in t hellishly overcrowded assume the remote lounge would have been empty tired with ancient entertainment system but quiet upper deck the same except crowded and busy on the only deck although both did have new first class so some upgrading had occurred just not all of it crew however excellent throughout in both direction so well done particularly return leg which had considerable number of young child making for demanding work food both direction actually quite decent continual drink service for first half of flight e w then help yourself in galley good value a we gained big discount when booking a holiday package had i paid full fare would have been very disappointed though doesn t near match up to the main opposition these day too many seat in an inconvenient layout i do wonder if ba have given up going for the business traveller in premium class on some long haul route now a they have for short haul club and now see the higher spending family a their revenue source maybe that s why we got the antique to fly in,positive
travelled from venice to gatwick on th may check in staff rude and unhelpful plane seat and food tray dirty and seat very worn and uncomfortable lady next to me had her arm rest fall off during the flight food for my daughter inedible attendant very lacklustre nappy changing table fell on my mum whilst on the toilet attendant suggested we sue ba wrote to ba to complain got fobbing off email in return won t be wasting my money on business class again shocking service and standard from start to finish,negative
worst customer experience on ba flight i have a confirmed flight for british airway from singapore to sydney for tomorrow when i tried to check online the system did not allow me to do online check in i called the ba contact center in the uk and wa shocked with the response received the person told me that there is a difference between confirmed booking and confirmed seating essentially ba want to sell their seat at a premium they arm twist the passenger and make lame excuse that although you have confirmed flight booking it doesn t mean you can fly unless you get the seat allocation we are travelling a a family but got scattered seat very embittered with the overall experience will never fly again with british airway,negative
i had this terrible experience of traveling british airway from heathrow to calgary the plane wa parked in a no man area and we were bussed to the plane to my horror i had to climb through the stair with my carry on bag the width of the seat and the leg space is the smallest i saw in my year of travel experience it s a shame that that the airline is using this kind of carrier for a transatlantic flight the quality of food is one of the worst i have ever seen i picked the non veg chicken item the taste and content wa hopeless the container wa marked for expiry a an expiry after month but marked for the hour and minute the only positive thing i can think of in this torture for hour is the attitude and service of the cabin crew they were great,negative
ba th june if this were the first flight i had taken with british airway i would not be impressed at check in there is a lack of professionalism the customer doe not come first even at the first class check in staff interrupt each other and discus their own business in priority to completing the check in the flight wa in fact delayed by an hour despite the information such a wa provided given a ten minute the aircraft appeared dated and not especially clean with crumb on the seat and grease mark on the window the inflight shopping wa made difficult a there were no inflight duty free magazine available in club class inflight entertainment system did not work whilst the food wa good it had to be changed a the first offering wa cold inflight crew were pleasant and efficient upon arrival the baggage reclaim took no account of priority passenger,negative
i flew from heathrow to tokyo haneda in first the concorde lounge at heathrow wa quite good though i wa surprised by how little choice there wa when it came to food the seat on the new first wa good the service wa all right the food on board wa poor a it ha been each time i ve flown first over the year to find something edible i had to retreat to the snack bar in business i wa particularly disappointed because ba is still my first choice for economy and it is fine in business apart from the bizarre seating configuration,positive

her lgw our return flight confirmed our view that club europe is a waste of money on this new route her is infamous a a relic of the s and ba have done nothing to improve that check in wa interminable despite a club europe desk there wa a fast track option for security but this wa roped off for our flight no lounge wa offered even though there are lounge available and used by other airline not surprisingly there wa no priority boarding our seat d and e are the only decent seat in the new club europe service on board wa adequate lgw wa the usual nightmare taking minute to crawl through the boarder control fiasco we certainly wouldn t want to repeat our ba experience to and from her,negative

flew from heathrow to san francisco on may st with ba what a disappointment i had to pay over to sit next to my husband having already paid for the flight then we couldn t access the entertainment for over minute at the start of the flight due to some technical problem and again later in the flight it went off for about minute presumably due to the same problem our first meal wa served more or less straight away and it wa ok typical airline fare but there wa then over hour wait for the next meal which wa laughably called afternoon tea one piece of bread cut into quarter with chicken and a scone with cream and butter four hour after the main meal they ran out of snack and when my husband went in search of something to eat they gave him two pack of nut and said they were for the return journey don t they stock up before picking up the next passenger luckily my husband always carry chocolate bar with him a he is diabetic but heaven know what might have happened had he needed food from the staff before half way two of the toilet went out of service so there were some queue would i fly ba again certainly not long haul although unfortunately i have to return to heathrow with them from boston today,positive

lhr yyz in world traveller plus upgrade in a yyz lhr in economy in a i got an upgrade for the outbound flight which wa a bonus there were a few niggles on the outbound flight sound cancelling headphone but the sound quality wa poor even at maximum volume the reading light worked but wa inadequate probably because it wa too far away the cabin temperature wa a little erratic and there were queue for the four toilet in economy it could have been a problem if we had been flying through prolonged turbulence but a i said these were just niggles i enjoyed the upgrade and the flight the return wa delayed and the apu unserviceable not uncommon with a we had to wait for a second air starter unit if it requires two order them in advance and it got rather stuffy whilst waiting the pilot kept u informed of what wa happening once underway it wa a good flight and i rested well cheerful and efficient crew in both direction food wa good outbound and adequate inbound some area for improvement but overall very good and would recommend ba,positive
ba krk lhr may a new sector launched just early this month and my first time flying ba i wa pleasantly surprised for my friend that he wa able to check in his big carry on for free while i paid for check in luggage i understood why in the end my biggest gripe ha to be that the sunday flight departs and arrives late into lhr this wa worsened by the fact that it wa a full flight but the overhead bin were already full before all were on board hence there wa a minute delay on the tarmac a remaining hand carry luggage had to be put in the hold unfortunately flight did not manage to catch up while in the air hence we landed minute late cutting it close to the curfew time for lhr we had to run all the way through and almost missed the last heathrow express train i will never fly a late flight into lhr again that said the pilot and cabin crew were entertaining quite chatty over the pa and with some passenger though not necessarily friendly to all customer hour on an a passed by without any in flight entertainment to be expected for regional flight and with some food and refreshment which were good,positive
punta cana gatwick world traveller plus cabin on b i find this particular cabin very noisy possibly due to proximity of the engine seat are comfortable and leg room and elbow room significantly better than economy the front row of world traveller pu ha even more legroom but be warned that this is a mixed blessing since this row is fitted with shelf for strapping down baby cradle and if you sit next to a passenger who requires this facility then it will severely compromise your space ife wa ok but nothing special main meal wa ok but breakfast wa an absolute disgrace a dry cheese croissant and a small granola bar no alternative offered i know this is not business class but for the premium i paid for world traveller plus i feel entitled to something better than this really very poor take it or leave it excuse for a breakfast the drink service wa nothing special either one round of juice or water before take off an offer of wine with dinner and another juice and water run after dinner then nothing until breakfast regarding the crew some were engaging and friendly but far too many others were offhand and unsmiling when in all innocence i used a toilet in the business class cabin i found a member of cabin crew waiting for me when i emerged who promptly berated me for my mistake fair enough but when i explained that other passenger in world traveller plus had also used the toilet in business class i wa virtually called a liar i backed off from an argument but i found the experience upsetting and i simply couldn t get to sleep thereafter i eventually disembarked at lgw hungry thirsty and a somewhat unhappy bunny in summary world traveller plus is probably just about worth it for the extra comfort and space but don t get your expectation too high in term of food and drink and be prepared for inconsistent inflight service,negative
sadly flying british airway is no longer about a great experience it is a seat on a flight which you pay a lot of money for we had a number of issue that we tried to get resolved via customer service but were told they couldn t do anything until our journey had ended we were very disappointed with this approach and their inability to address our issue during our journey ba staff at heathrow told u the wrong information about reclaiming our baggage causing big issue the plane wa overly hot on both leg of the flight and we were told by cabin crew on both flight this is a known problem on these older plane the breakfast on our return flight wasn t fit for consumption an ice cold hard croissant after hour of no food really poor service and even worse customer service,negative
after a recent flight to st lucia with ba if i have a choice in future i will fly with another airline from the start of the return trip we experienced problem headset failed to work on reporting this to the cabin crew i wa informed that you need to jiggle it to make a connection so needed to unpack my own kit to watch a movie meal time the only choice left wa pasta one with cheese and one without the passenger next to me had the pasta it looked like it had been re heated with the cover off very hard on mentioning it to the cabin staff all she got wa their cutting down in all area re the movie this picture quality wa a disgrace picture and sound kept braking up i switched my phone on and again used my own music to get me through the hour trip i have cancelled my ba membership,negative

first off this particular flight from ewr to lhr and back wa advertised a a boeing dreamliner the actual jet wa a much less comfortable the flight going to london wa hour delayed coming into ewr something about a diversion regarding a sick passenger in boston ma in fact they had not allocated a crew coming home my pre paid seat were changed in premium economy to seat next to w c s so i had the pleasure of smelling excretion and gas the whole flight i wa also emailed an offer for an upgrade then that email wa followed up with one that stated that the first one wa sent in error fact i did get back to the usa reality ba no more never again the problem with ba is not their cabin crew who are quite nice the problem is that their customer service is a joke cannot recommend this airline,positive

ba bangkok to london heathrow may th world traveller plus premium economy first the positive check in at bkk wa reasonably efficient the flight departed on time and landed at lhr about minute early unfortunately while world traveller plus provides some extra leg room when compared to economy there wa nothing else about our flight experience that justified the additional cost of world traveller plus the cabin seating and equipment were tired the entertainment system wa old and barely functional however by far the worst aspect of the flight wa the poor service from the cabin crew who almost without exception appeared uninterested in customer service to the point of rudeness their strategy seemed to be to minimise their exposure to customer in order to maximise the time they could spend in the galley at the rear of the aircraft after the first meal service an uninspiring chicken curry with boiled to death broccoli and carrot not remotely resembling the misleadingly optimistic description found on the ba website about the supposed enhanced dining experience of world traveller plus call for service went unanswered for lengthy period of time it seemed the only effective way to obtain further service wa to walk to the rear galley where staff congregated and made it clear they did not appreciate being interrupted barely acknowledging request while continuing their conversation and grudgingly fulfilling request to a bare minimum in stark contrast to the excellent cabin service food and entertainment option we experienced flying in economy on qantas to bangkok the previous day this so called premium experience on ba wa extremely disappointing our advice don t waste your money on ba world traveller plus,negative

club world just flown london gatwick to la vega in club world and very disappointed staff were not particularly helpful gave the impression that everything they did they were doing you a favour the seating of in a business cabin is unfair trying to pack too many people in they didn t offer anything to try to make you feel a bit special and i had paid a lot of money for the ticket i normally fly virgin atlantic on this route and will defiantly be using them in the future,negative
we travelled on flight ba from heathrow to singapore on th july and it is most unlikely we would travel with them again we were supposed to depart at and had arrived early to escape the rush and heat of london when we checked the departure board we noticed no gate number had been allotted to our flight we hung around gate a area and waited for further advice and waited and waited the clock ticked on and we all waited for the advice the board is supposed to display come supposed to be boarding and still no gate number or advice a to the delayed boarding i could go on and on but finally at yes minute after scheduled departure time the board declared that we had to go to gate b area for a departure still no explanation a to why we were an hour late we caught the transit service and headed over there finally boarding the plane after the rescheduled departure time the air conditioning wa virtually non functional and we were forced to sit in the stinking heat waiting for some sort of explanation and apology the staff seemed surly and disinterested in our discomfort and one stewardess near u at the rear of the plane refused two request from passenger to bring water using the defence that she wa on my own back here and cannot leave my post incredibly she left her post several time when it suited her to talk to other steward etc about the captain announced that they had lost a passenger and we should depart within minute finally at we took off after sitting in the terrible heat and humidity of all those body for over an hour with no service of drink or anything else after boarding over an hour late yes we departed hour and minute late and still without explanation or apology of any kind from any of the staff the air conditioning did not start to reduce the temperature until more than hour into the flight when we landed at singapore the captain announced that he hoped the ongoing passenger hadn t been too inconvenienced by the hold up i guess that wa ba s apology totally disgraceful ba andwe still don t know why we were delayed,negative

lgw her a on one of ba s new tourist orientated route sadly this felt more like a charter flight with screaming kid in the row behind an appalling hot breakfast and the penny pinching new club europe seat which are identical in width and pitch to economy if this is the way ba are going it doesn t make sense to pay the extra they really should think again about their premium service,negative
gatwick to florida return flight out wa quite good with an attentive crew choice of meal found the seatback tv screen very small and selection of movie and audio choice wa poor legroom could be a lot better too and i feel that ba need to update their b on this route return flight wa delayed two hour but wa informed by the airline by text and email on check in a vouches wa given to buy drink or a snack i found the food on the return flight very poor with only chicken or pasta available and the breakfast consisted of a stale croissant and jam and a raisin bar that wa virtually indelible i would consider flying ba to florida again if their price are comparable to other carrier,negative
lgw cun lgw husband and i had middle seat both outbound and return we found seat comfortable for seating and sleeping crew on outbound were a lot more efficient and friendlier than the inbound crew where the service wa a bit haphazard and one particular crew member who wa a few year older than the others wa rather offhand and didn t smile much at all outboard there were empty seat all around u so we did not have to sit face to face with stranger or climb over anyone when leaving our seat but cabin wa quite full inboard so we did not enjoy the flight a much the club world cabin is definitely cramped compared with other business class cabin and i do not know what ba were thinking when they decided to pack in so many seat and in such a way a to make it very awkward for less mobile passenger to exit their seat storage space is lacking around the seat due to ba trying to fit too many passenger into too small a space i would not say i would not travel club world with ba again but would look at alternative airline with different cabin layout first,positive

lgw rak lgw may these flight were on ba s newly configured a s we paid for emergency exit row seat on both way and very thankful that we did british airway have reduced the legroom in both economy business class to and at the normal legroom now is quite tight the seat themselves are quite comfortable and having storage at the top of the seat mean you don t lose your legroom the service on board wa excellent friendly staff both way provided with a wrap roll cheese and biscuit and a chocolate mousse both way return not a nice a outbound and they offer complimentary drink looking at business class all you get is the middle seat free and no extra legroom a lounge and a hot meal so wouldn t think it s worth the upgrade fee anymore having travelled many time in club with ba new product is not a winner from what i could see i would fly british airway again and would recommend them,positive

our flight on economy long distance from the austin to heathrow wa the most uncomfortable we ve had on any carrier and we have travelled extensively the seat were so close together with hardly any leg room or arm movement that not only wa it difficult to eat the food which wa dreadful but very difficult to get in and out of without damaging or twisting a knee or back we had extreme exhaustion on landing from discomfort and lack of sleep the evening meal we were served wa inedible the pasta had been hanging around for some time by the appearance it wa dry and congealing in what wa once tomato sauce the foil container wa bent and the foil cover crumpled which prof it had been handled and heated up frequently a for the breakfast in a box it wa so bad i cannot comment we ve had better food and seating on low budget airline and a well a on myanmar airline we want to support our national airline but definitely not on ba economy it seems all the attention and care is given to first and business class a huge disappointment,negative
ba ba just completed my first ba flight in club world the experience can be summed up in a single word pathetic the flight taxied and took off with passenger sleeping with their seat flat in the centre couple seat the crew wa totally indifferent the light meal post take off wa offered only to passenger in the aisle seat for reason best known to the crew if you are seated in the centre couple seat you have to be either an acrobat or a gymnast to access the toilet a you have to jump over a sleeping passenger in the aisle to get there the buggy requested to transport u to the lounge at heathrow a my wife had just had surgery showed up but the lady driving it decided we did not need it and walked off a a result we had to trek for hr to clear security and reach the lounge will never travel ba again,positive

over the last couple of year i have travelled to china by emirate klm virgin atlantic and ba the next time i travel ba will be my last choice i got the impression from the very start that ba are penny pinching at every opportunity their lounge are basic and the food minimal although having a seat on the plane only a few row down from the front some meal selection had run out the cabin staff hid behind curtain most of the flight therefore service wa at a minimum if you have a window seat you have to straddle the person in the inside seat if you need to get out,positive

flew ba on open jaw route bru lhr lax returning one week later sfo lhr bru bru lhr wa on an a newly refurbished plane i paid for seating selection week before the day before on line check in opened i saw that some seat on the front of the plane became available to economy traveller with no surcharge so i took one of them to deplane a quick a possible the plane landed a little bit ahead of schedule anyway lhr lax on the a wa a really nice experience really smooth flight and incredibly quiet upper deck cabin food wa not bad a long a you don t expect anything too fancy in economy there wa only one complete meal after take off and a pre arrival snack before landing on an hour flight this may seem not enough but passenger are welcome to pick up snack in the galley during the flight a well a having drink fixed on demand only one negative spot of the flight the cabin wa really cold sfo lhr still on the a departed a little bit late due to a malfunction of one of the door but crew kept u informed of the situation same nice experience nice crew and so on lhr bru on an a departed late after being stuck on tarmac due to high departure rate at heathrow once again the captain kept u informed and managed to catch most of the delay before landing in brussels overall really nice experience but i wish they would not charge a much for seating selection before online check in a i may be a nervous flyer i need a window seat and don t want to risk seating elsewhere the four leg cost me more than euro on pre paid seating which i could take into account when choosing between ba and an another airline that let you choose free of charge when booking your flight besides that i won t hesitate to fly ba in the future,positive

this wa the first time i have flown with ba and i have to say i wa very impressed i flew economy from brisbane to lhr return via singapore on the outgoing trip and hong kong on the return leg the experience wa so much better than on previous flight i had taken with competing airline the cabin felt spacious and comfortable even in economy there wa a good range of inflight entertainment and all staff were extremely friendly and helpful the cost of the flight wa a little more expensive than other airline but having been very satisfied with the service it would not preclude me from booking with them again would preference them over other airline now following that trip along with recommending them to others,positive

lgw pisa i wrote a positive experience a few week ago on the lhr route to pisa i am pleased to write wait for it another positive review this time it wa the old club europe and better in my view a i said before it a shame ba cannot produce something exceptional rather than very good when it come to the seat the lounge wa okay not to crowded flight left minute late very nice meal on board really tasty and fresh nice smoked salmon and so on a few gin and t s washed it down friendly fa s smooth flight my only gripe we were parked off station on the outer airport like ryanair a small hassle with a walk over the tarmac bag were not given priority which wa annoying all in all a good experience,positive
excellent experience lhr to hkg wa a bit apprehensive about their reputation but found the whole trip excellent staff were friendly and helpful aircraft wa clean and ife gave a wide choice drink offered half an hour into the flight and meal served within an hour would definitely travel with ba again,positive
we flew premium economy class from singapore to london on a carrier it wa a waste of money the plane looked year old and nothing seemed to work properly the entertainment system remote control wa stuck to it base and it had to be removed with a sharp instrument the little screen showed a blurred picture so it wa not worth watching movie the crew wa nowhere to be seen and they couldn t be called if you needed something because the call button had been cancelled on all remote control at some stage i went to the toilet and went through the kitchen the crew wa there talking and laughing and one of them wa sitting reading the paper shame on you ba never again,negative
lhr syd lhr via singapore i hadn t flown ba long haul for over fifteen year and so given some of the rather negative review on this site i approached the experience with trepidation however i needn t have worried everything wa tip top from on line check in bag drop lounge boarding on time departure and arrival on both leg and prompt luggage collect the aircraft both way wa a newish er clean and well maintained and while the herring bone seat configuration doe seem a bit weird on both sector i wa in the last row window seat facing backwards with an empty seat next to me so i wa able to slip in and out easily enough and didn t have anyone facing me the seat wa a little narrow for business class but very comfortable with lot of storage space and no shortage of pillow and blanket the ife wa excellent screen on the small side but very good definition and audio food wa simple but very good quality fresh well presented and lot of it very generous with the booze excellent champagne wine and some fine malt whisky all served correctly by the wonderfully attentive fa old school british middle aged lady and gentleman chatty and polite to the point of parody but the twinkle in their eye tell you that they know it an excellent experience keep it up ba,positive
lhr mad with ba on a boeing er very full flight but it didn t stop the crew from delivering superb customer service drink and sandwich offered minute after take off second round of drink offered very cheerful crew helpful and friendly pilot personally came out to greet passenger on our way out very smooth take off landing could be better would definitely fly with british airway again,positive

a short haul from gatwick to rome and i had no expectation check in wa quick and we were on a vintage boeing all in all very happy they supplied a decent enough snack drink service wa efficient there wa no in flight entertainment available but we should all be able to cope for hour without surely comfortable enough friendly service got there on time and good price all add up to a happy traveller,positive

heathrow to bilbao this is one of ba s new route although they used to fly the route year ago on a b and we got our return flight for a bargain ba s hand luggage only fare to europe offer very good value and i wonder when they will consider this pricing tier for long haul route the a flight left from heathrow terminal which is closing in june but now look and feel like a ghost town there were shop open on the day of our departure and most of it is boarded up a for the flight we had the usual ba chaotic boarding process but overall an excellent flight even if the new seat are uncomfortable and certainly similar to ryanair with hardly any space i appreciate ba s offering of sandwich on their short haul flight but do wonder whether passenger really need this service nowadays,positive
ncl lhr return great alternative to rail travel which is sometimes more expensive check in wa a breeze on both side new comfortable a cabin old one were really aged a choice of snack and drink were served with option for alcohol delay arriving into heathrow a usual the airport is really over capacity and limiting ba a an airline annoyed that you are no longer able to choose your seat on hand baggage only fare,positive
flew from london heathrow to rome fiumicino flew the same route last year too and both time it wa excellent this time our flight wa operated with an airbus a with slim line seat that looked brand new these were very comfortable for a short haul flight and the leg room sufficient in flight catering wa excellent coffee wa a bit weak but the sandwich were delicious this time cheese and ham doorstop with white bread i expected good thing after last year flat bread and wa not disappointed cabin crew were very friendly and efficient a were the airport staff boarding process wa fast and efficient and on both flight at arrival and destination the aircraft wa at a jet bridge so no need to board a bus flight departed and arrived on time will definitely fly ba again,positive
club europe lhr am the boarding process wa a joke we had to take the bus to our aircraft in the boarding lounge they asked for all club europe and gold and silver to come forward and board the bus then they let all of the remaining passenger board the bus which made priority boarding a total joke they should follow the same process when flight land at a remote stand and have a separate bus just for use by club europe passenger at least when departing club europe passenger would enjoy their priority boarding i understand there is a need for on time departure but ba really need to ensure that where priority boarding is taking place their club passenger receive it,positive
ba newcastle to heathrow check in at newcastle wa a always very fast and efficient once on board the cabin crew did a great job of welcoming everyone a great crew offering old school ba charm at it s best and no small achievement considering the very early departure time new and very compact seating which seems to be the new norm for economy class travel on short haul european flight flight arrived at t not quite on time a i remember but hey ho not at all bad,positive
flew gatwick to kingston return big disappointment had to climb over stranger leg to leave seat not all option of food available if your at the end of the meal run need to pay to sit together separated from my husband who wa next to a nice bloke who wa happy to move so we could sit together ba did not even try to accommodate u not worth the money virgin far superior from their lounge to the flight will never travel ba long haul again be warned don t waste your money,positive
ba heathrow to newcastle checked in at t by an agent who should train some of the others very welcoming instantly struck up a conversation with me this person wa a credit to the company and a much needed one the good experience ended there punctuality reared it s ugly head once more i ve recorded this repeatedly departure wa delayed minute not the end of the world but an inconvenience which happens so regularly i can pretty much count on it it s a shame ba can t address these issue and get flight operating to schedule the majority of the time a other airline are well able to once on board ba is like a tale of two airline some crew are excellent others just lack professionalism and behave rather strangely at time possibly this may stem from the two tier or mixed fleet system but whatever the issue may be crew quality and service is inconsistent when we landed at newcastle a crew member announced that the flight wa only minute behind schedule well marvellous not in my opinion having just flown around the world on another airline which wa able to operate twelve out of thirteen flight either on time or ahead of schedule i have to say that i remain generally unimpressed,positive
hong kong to london in world it wa on the a first time aboard and must say i wa impressed a much better experience than the emirate a great mood lighting large window nice to have a number of small cabin on both deck friendly service from the crew,positive
april sydney lhr staff were quite attentive and pleasant throughout both sector the cabin looked very new wa clean and comfortable ife wa fine although not a good a cx i wa sitting in window seat facing backwards which wa fine the seat while sitting is comfortable enough although quite narrow there is little storage and it can be awkward getting in and out of the seat especially when you are on the window the problem wa when the seat wa in flat bed mode it is so narrow that you cannot turn the seat buckle in the middle a well the passenger next to me would slam his table and tv monitor shut throughout the flight and because of the design the seat you feel every movement to get comfortable i had to put the seat in more of a recline mode in order to sleep which defeat the whole purpose of a flat bed a well a fold down footstool completes the end of the bed and it wasn t stable ba are charging a premium for this seat and they squeeze across compared to for cx they are making a great deal out of this amount of real estate in the air it is time for them to deliver an update the only reason i took this fare wa because of the great luggage offering which i needed on this occasion kg and the fact that i wa flying back in first for no additional cost which i will post about separately so while i recommend this airline overall it is more because the service and staff did compensate next time i fly business it will be cx again the seat is a real let down,positive
th aug flight ba me and my friend flew from san to lhr then to ist our check in and baggage process took almost hour to be completed i wonder what would happen if we were not been there hour before our flight when they gave u our ticket we saw that they put u all separately they could not even manage to sit u together when i wa thinking how could this get worse we missed our lhr ist flight and waited in a queue for hour to go to our hotel while a clerk wa trying to complete our check in for hour another clerk next to her managed to complete half of the passenger process and when we were boarding the plane we learnt that the plane wa overbooked and the other cl erk wa offering dollar per person and free accommodation for volunteer passenger to fly on the next plane,positive
april lhr sydney via singapore i flew first a part of a promotion for no additional cost with purchase of business seat on syd lhr leg i really enjoyed the concorde room at terminal lovely meal great service and very elegant space in term of the flight the fa were very friendly and helpful on all leg they went out of their way to make you feel special and a guest food wa very good a wa wine offering seat wa comfortable and roomy although there is a lot less storage then in cx business seat in fact while there is a lot of room much of it really is not that useful at night fa did disappear for much of the time and didn t really come around except once to offer water juice whereas on sq economy fa would check on you regularly throughout flight while of course it is very special to fly first next time i would be just a happy to fly cx business which i think is really great value for money and the seat are just a or maybe even more comfortable if i had paid full fare for this flight i think i would have been questioning the value for money,positive
ba st march ba th april ba make u think better quality however the flight to and from cyprus is now disappointing in term of food offered the duration is over hour and it is not acceptable for them to offer cold sandwich,negative
ba lhr gva apr are fooling no one with their new club europe business class seat they look nice but are too close together providing extremely poor legroom a a regular london to geneva traveller i will go back to flying swiss the decision to change this is almost a bad a the stupid decision to have seat facing backwards in club world where you have to face stranger and climb over others to get to your seat if you can t fly first class with ba choose another airline until they remedy these issue because their business class product is rubbish,negative
ba world traveller apr bangkok heathrow london ba world traveller apr heathrow london bangkok the check in staff were unhelpful and refused to check my luggage through despite it being done on the first leg of my trip i also met others on the same flight where this wa allowed the plane wa old the cabin crew were professional however compared to the middle eastern airline the service wasnt nearly a good,negative
lhr bkk in club on b fourth long haul leg on ba in the last month and this wa by far the best flight that said i still think the product is disappointing i m the camp that say the seat are highly uncomfortable they are far too narrow a an average sized person still find their arm draped across the arm rest while trying to sleep you simply can t keep your arm by your side a such little to no sleep ife outdated and awful,negative
lhr am lhr in club europe on a nice service for a short hop i think ba s club europe product is better than their long haul product no flat bed but aircraft were in good condition cabin crew professional efficient and genuinely nice food wa actually edible with a cheese and charcuterie plate both flight delayed due to heathrow congestion and amsterdam weather but other than that a pretty good experience,positive
lhr phl ba th april one of the feature of a british airway ba flight that attracted me in the past wa the breadth of special meal option this until recently included a seafood meal indeed ten year ago ba had fisherman s pie a an option in economy class not just the horrible and relentless chicken or pasta then they boasted of their support for the british fishing industry no longer seafood meal are gone why from a ba response i d like to inform you that the meal have been removed due to the low volume with many of our customer now choosing other option indeed if no seafood meal exists then there is no choice there are no option there is only chicken or pasta really what would it take to offer a cold seafood meal a tuna fish salad and a bread roll one more reason to choose ba is gone one more reason to fly with a middle eastern airline such a etihad who still care about service of a sort that ba ha started to abandon,positive
flew ba man jfk first flight full but smooth second flight on old but clean with good leg room wifi and food good wa just thinking a we were landing early what a good flight it had been when landing wa aborted abruptly and we circled again eventually the captain said that two warning light had gone off but the problem appeared to be rectified his manner remained calm and the plane landed safely me and several around me were obviously very anxious,positive
april airbus a business heathrow to lisbon a total waste of money the food wa horrible a couple of sandwich and a lousy bread served with jam there wa no entertainment system and the only difference i could find from economy wa that the middle seat wa empty and a portable table wa placed between the arm rest the seat pitch wa pathetic and could not even get a rest i am very disappointed that i did not choose tap instead of british,negative
lhr to syd on and ack to lhr on after some poor review i wa a little worry a to the quality and whether premium economy would be worth the extra cost i have previously travelled down under with cathay and malaysian and wondered how ba would measure up i wa pleasantly surprised cabin on both plane wa clean staff mostly attentive hong kong leg to heathrow staff were worst of the leg ok but didn t seem overly interested in going the extra mile a a taller person i appreciated the additional legroom and recline although when passenger in front reclined it is tricky to get out of your seat i had veggie meal which were generally tasty and a usual served prior to everyone else i did have to remind staff on the last leg to offer me a drink when they served everyone else s meal film selection wa excellent travelling shortly after oscar season meant most of the big nominated film were available i will definitely pay for pe again on long haul,positive
my experience on return ba flight to lhr to tokyo narita in april score very low i used to fly on virgin atlantic for the same journey on business class for the past year so i have something to compare and the fare is always more or less the same between those airline conclusion is that you get far better value and service for money for the business class on virgin wa my impression ba t lounge is very photogenic but the reality is quite basic and cheap decor selection of food and beverage is limited in the end i got fed up so i left the lounge to get better food from wetherspoons since i m small both airline seat are fine to get a good sleep on ba you d still have to pay to select your seat despite paying thousand of pound also if you are in the middle aisle on ba you are right next to a stranger which is awkward ba give out elemi kit food on ba there is a fixed option for the dessert you have to choose either cake or cheese not both also not too different a menu from economy class ba s service felt extremely limited they don t know your name they just do the very minimum service ba disappointed me,positive
my return flight from heathrow to bologna last week reminded me of how good ba is for short haul in economy even a two hour delay because of technical problem on the outgoing flight did nothing to change that view the pilot kept u up to date on what wa happening the crew were charming ok the snack of a sandwich on such flight is pretty basic but the whole experience is so much more civilized than on budget airline,positive
gatwick to thessaloniki return outbound ok not fantastic but certainly not bad however where ba scored wa on the return at check in the clerk wa all prepared for my wife and i even though we were on separate booking including ready printed lounge pass with my guest pas stapled to her own maybe a little thing but it made a difference,positive
april airbus a business heathrow to rome fco a total waste of money the food wa tea there wa no entertainment system and the only difference i could find from premium coach or regular coach wa that the middle seat wa empty and a portable table wa placed between the arm rest a alcoholic beverage are provided for all class there s nothing to be gained there the seat pitch wa pathetic and aside from having the middle seat empty the only benefit to be had wa boarding and de planing first don t waste your money unless someone else is paying for it,negative
flew ba from delhi to heathrow usual ba issue which have been repeated here many time firstly the first cabin wa not clean at all with debris on the floor food still in the seat it s pretty pathetic when you have to spend minute cleaning your area when you board the food the food can only be described a truly awful to be honest i would be complaining if i received this standard of food in economy the starter wa a watery oily leek and potato soup and for the main two small lamb chop overdone in gravy with tiny potato that deflated when pierced with a fork i did not bother with desert afternoon tea served up probably the worst patisserie i have ever had the displeasure of tasting completely inedible the cabin crew were good and pleasant however i wa not offered any bottled water for a hour flight it would seem to me that ba are a budget airline trying to do luxury and failing horribly surely management cannot be happy with their current standard but i am struggling to see any level of improvement i take at least first class international flight every year have flown ba for year will now be trying other airline the lounge not run by ba but used by ba at delhi wa very good indeed,positive
april ba business class seattle usa heathrow check in easy lounge good boarding pleasant food quality wa good not excellent but the film choice wa great flat bed seat were comfortable enough the breakfast wa a little skimpy the major downside wa that for the money you pay for business class you should not have to pay to choose a seat at booking ba will let you choose seat day in advance if you are a mileage plan st elevated tier or better member but if not then you have to wait until hour ahead of course you can always fork over another to pre reserve a seat talk about biting the hand that feed you,positive
del lhr ba seat ab downstairs in business class in b g bnly the aircraft is an old lady now but the interior is well maintained her age wa most noticeable looking at the in flight screen i have become used to the clarity of modern screen and the faded dim and blurred old fashioned moving map and flight information screen are a relic of a distant past i have made several long haul flight with ba in business class recently and have decided that i don t like the standard ba model business class seat there is nowhere to put small item like glass pen landing card and so on there is a drawer at floor level suitable for shoe and other item you will not want during the flight but to access it you need an upright seat and have to sit well forward to lean down to it there is no foot rest integrated into the seat one you can adjust to your own preferred level at the front of the seat pod is a flap then can be lowered by getting out of the seat it is not strong and so can not be used a a seat and is not an ottoman clunky and peculiar to ba it is not a design feature that enhances the seat individual seat feel narrow and the window seat pod facing aft is accessed through a narrow entrance leading into a snug and very private space thought about coffin come to mind when the passenger in the row behind ha their seat flat their foot cross the entrance to yours and have to be stepped over to exit seat b wa a poor choice it is just aft of a set of catering cupboard that are frequently accessed during meal service and a washroom that seems to be in use almost continuously with queue stretching past the seat after meal and before landing on the good side the seat are well contoured and comfortably padded,positive
we flew for the very first time on ba on and returned our holiday to st lucia from gatwick wa booked through kuoni and we usually fly with virgin atlantic we always upgrade with virgin to premium economy a you have a larger luggage allowance and the premium economy experience with virgin is very good therefore we booked ba world traveller plus expecting the same degree of service what a disappointment i would not advise wasting your upgrade money apart from getting the larger luggage allowance ba world traveller plus is almost exactly the same a world traveller the service both way wa appalling the seat were old and shabby and uncomfortable we were only offered bar service once on a hour flight we had to drink from plastic beaker the staff seemed preoccupied with business class customer and had no time for our section at all on the way back my husband and myself were given seat row apart at check in without being told we only noticed when we boarded the aircraft on this length of flight i wa most upset we were apart a everyone sat near me were single traveller and were asleep throughout the hour the seat back tv are very small and my tv didn t work properly and i couldn t even watch anything the aircraft wa badly in need of an interior upgrade we will never fly with ba again anywhere and will not recommend the experience to anyone,negative

lhr fra in club europe first part is not really a review more a rant i travel a lot for work and always try to fly ba whenever possible and so am lucky enough to have a gold card so for our annual vacation i wa looking forward to hopefully getting u all wife plus year old daughter into the first class lounge at lhr a a nice start to our holiday sadly the staff member on the door said no yes i know you can only normally sign in guest but for my other flight a year i never sign in anyone still no joy computer said no so i asked the guy behind me if he would mind signing my wife into the lounge at which pointthe staff member told him quite aggressively that is not protocol we walked away having been made to feel like naughty kid rest of the trip wa fine in fact i would go a far a to say the flight wa excellent really friendly cabin crew who made u feel welcome and gave u a good start to the holiday actually i would say this wa ba at it best having just seen them at their worst score given here reflect the good service in the air would give almost full mark if not for the ground staff behaviour,positive
travelled man lhr atl and back boarding at man chaotic with queue in a corridor probably not ba s fault delayed departure from lhr on a very full food and wine good but the club world cabin is very cramped with very little space to put anything i don t mind the back and front seating i could look at my wife but the seat is narrow and not the most comfortable for sleeping very good attentive crew wide variety of film music on ife on return the third party lounge club at atl is much better than the delta one full flight very similar to outbound but slightly early arrival at lhr wa negated by the domestic flight being delayed by minute due to runway problem,positive
ba ist lhr boeing euro traveller cabin read the review and we pre booked exit row seat a b excellent choice leg room superb i m m tall and could stretch right out with a window too still an old though with no personal entertainment or power appeared to have the newer seat which were ok surprisingly the four hour flight passed quite quickly food wa actually very good and the crew superb disappointing choice of alcohol though no jd or rum departed ist about twenty minute late but were only ten minute late into lhr well done ba better than the outward experience reviewed earlier,positive
while i booked with ba i at first did not realise that they were putting me on a vueling airline but flying under a ba number quite clearly this airline is at the bottom of the bucket airline in both service and comfort a we were flying back from barcelona to the uk having my knee wedged up against the seat in front only lasted a couple of hour the food service which you had to pay for wa indifferent and very expensive if you sat in the middle of the plane you just didn t get served probably the most worrying thing besides the extremely poor english by cabin and flight crew wa the cabin staff apparent indifference to seat being up right for landing preventing some passenger taking their over head luggage down while in the air and on landing passenger up and around while the aircraft wa moving perhaps uk bucket airline are not so bad,positive
ba mia lhr in club leg four of a seven leg ba adventure another disappointment which is becoming commonplace a in leg one bkk lhr my pre assigned business class seat that i had selected month before departure mysteriously vanished at the gate in the end ba needed the seat for a family to be seated together all well and good mind you but to have the audacity to charge passenger for these seat and give them away is absolutely disgraceful a such my quiet no traffic window seat on the upper deck wa quickly relegated to a high traffic aisle seat on the main deck right near the lavatory and galley ensuring no sleep on the overnight flight a a loyal oneworld emerald passenger i can honestly say ba really don t care about u in this or any regard the csd wa sympathetic and kind but nobody else seemed to care one bit that hasn t happened to me on any other carrier for year and ha happened twice in the past few week on ba moral of the story never ever pay ba for a pre assigned seat a there is simply no guarantee you will get what you pay for moral of the story part fly another carrier if you can a it can t be much worse than ba,positive

flew th march lhr yvr return with my school on a rugby tour people seat were reasonably comfortable and they catered to my food request of no pork well enjoyed it but the ife wa absolutely horrendous and did not meet my expectation of british airway outdated movie with tv show from month before since we were flying on a boeing there were more seat per aisle but this made the cabin feel quite cramped one recommendation for them put fewer seat per aisle even though there were negative flying outbound i have to say the return wa great i had swapped seat with another boy who wanted to sit next to someone so i sat in the extra legroom seat ife wa far better and due to having the window seat i wa able to sleep for around hour when i wa awoke by the breakfast snack which wa decent food had no flavour and wa quite spicy lentil masala but still edible although my experience on ba wa very enjoyable i heard many of my companion had to move seat because of the not working ife one of my coach had ordered orange juice so the cabin crew gave it to him a they were serving but then the other one would take it away for some reason and in the end they said they had none left he had flown with cathay pacific to manila the preceding week and he said that he had enjoyed that thoroughly one of his worst experience of air travel especially due to him being and rather large overall a decent experience but just met my expectation to improve british airway need to start to be able to compete with other airline like singapore emirate etihad cathay pacific and qantas a there service and level of comfort ha definitely taken over from ba,positive

very disappointing experience arrived at airport for a flight to nice and learnt it wa hour late with arriving aircraft nowhere in sight prior flight wa boarding also delayed having no luggage checked and seat available i thought i might get to nice after all in time no such luck whilst the flight continued to board for another minute i spent arguing with ba staff to even check whether they could get me on the flight first class lounge staff refused to call the gate all with flight is finalized in similar situation with other airline most notably lufthansa they always re opened the flight and got me on the only excuse wa it s the rule obviously ba staff in addition took call whilst handling my urgent request further delaying the process if i have a choice i will definitely use other airline in addition they have changed the seating in europe to come more in line with easyjet and ryanair at very uncomfortable doesn t help to upgrade to business same seat so you end up paying pound for a very predictable and unexciting food,negative
lhr sin ba first awful from booking to completion of the flight a a ba gold executive member at time of booking some month ago booked this flight on the new a only to be told by ba in may the equipment had been changed to the extremely old due to technical issue sold feeling a little let down secured seat a and a on the these are the best of a bad bunch a to i wonder why ba squeeze seat into such a small area where other airline only fit seat into the front section of s at the beginning of march i checked the booking online only to find that we had been moved to row in the middle this wa not acceptable i called the ba gold line to object only to be given numerous contradicting excuse non of which were valid whilst on the flight i found out that the passenger in a wa a lifetime gold member so i can only assume that rank ha it privilege now onto the flight arrogant staff with one exception really poor food served at different time a we were in the middle which meant we had different staff attending to u plane interior shabby not surprised for a plus year old plane along with the pa being inaudible i felt this to be a safety issue and when mentioned i wa ignored i booked this flight for u a part of a special far east holiday i had high expectation of ba first which have not been met in anyway what a total waste of money will now try to avoid flying ba in any of there class once i have redeemed my avios balance,negative

i have been a longstanding ba gold card holder and frequent business traveller ba ha now replaced all business class seat on short haul flight with seat so cramped that at i could not sit without great discomfort this show complete contempt for ba s customer i first encountered this on a round trip to brussels it will be eurostar for me in the future and air france for which i also gave a gold card on other short haul is the management so confident of it customer base that it can give u less space than easyjet offer,positive

comfortable seat and plenty of space but the food wa poor and the in flight entertainment system wa rubbish the screen were small and the picture quality terrible i liked that fact that the cabin crew were more mature people but the service wa far from attentive this is the first time i have flown with ba for over year and i will try and avoid it in future i have had much better flight with other airline,positive

british airway business class is outclassed by rival the lay out of the seat need sorting i do not expect people to step over me when i have my seat extended in order to get out of their seating area the inflight food wa poor drink were offered occasionally time on a ten hour flight slightly warm coffee ran out of ice the idea that you have a selection of food to choose from in the business class galley wa a joke non business class passenger used business class toilet and then helped themselves to the food inflight entertainment very poor the terrace lounge at gatwick is outdated no hot food apart from porridge we checked in at am a few piece of cold toast plus the usual cold meat and cheese booking business class with british airway is definitely not worth the money,negative
i have to admit to not being a fan of the ba club world business class configuration but this is what our travel agent came up with for our direct flight seating you head to toe allows them to get in seat across compared to their competitor normal on my flight row this gave them extra seat good for the bean counter but can cause problem for the passenger on my flight from mle to lgw hr minute i wa in b facing forward and in the bed position my foot were on a drop down stool fixed to the back of b the passenger in a facing back had to step over my leg to exit their seat and kicked me a number of time a they did this during the long flight it is illegal to drink alcohol in the airport in male and so after take off i wa looking forward to a cold lager the drink trolley came but all the beer including the lager wa warm the fa said that they had no mean of cooling the lager on board i cannot drink warm lager and i am not a spirit drinker and so went without i settled down to watch a film but my entertainment system would work for about minute and then shut itself down no entertainment system and i then found that some of the adjustment button on the seat did not appear to be working so it wa either sitting up or lying down and risk being kicked there were meal service on the flight the first one wa ok but when it came to the second one when they got to me last row in the cabin they had run out of food and all they could offer me wa a salad not the best flight in the world and when we arrived at lgw all the economy bag came off first and the club bag with priority tag attached came off last i have been in correspondence with ba and customer relation ha stated you traveled in the cabin you originally booked however the meal we serve and our in flight entertainment system is complimentary and not included in our fare the ba website ha a description of this service which includes extensive flight entertainment system seat convert to key position choice of light meal or four course dining ba claimed to be the world favorite airline they are not mine they also clam to fly to serve well a they say they did fly me from mle to lgw bt i am not quite sure where the service came in,positive

my partner and i booked a long weekend break with ba in nyc including flight from manchester and accommodation we deliberately selected the ba flight option for the round trip to save having to change terminal at london heathrow when i booked u in online hour before travel we discovered that our long haul flight had been changed to american airline th to th march this meant we had to change terminal t to t with very little time following our flight from manchester even with the priority transfer note it wa a very close call and very stressful not helped by the fact that we got held up trying to leave t due to a closed door the flight with aa wa ok but the food on both the outward and return leg wa disgusting and not at all what we expected the ba web site allowed me to book the arrival transfer but refused to allow me to book the return so i had to organise that myself i have rated the travel experience question based on the american airline flight to and from nyc the ba flight from manchester to heathrow were great we also struggled with the aa website when trying to check in for our return flight,negative

this is not reflective of ba in general only this particular flight i flew lhr abv on saturday th march this wa the friday th flight that had to be rescheduled due to technical issue now if anyone is familiar with this route you will know that service onboard is sometimes not a consistent a say the transatlantic route considering that the flight had been delayed hour one would have though that cabin crew would have been more attentive this is not to say they were in any way unprofessional they were just in a hurry to give you a drink and your meal there after you barely saw them duty free sped through the cabin faster than usian bolt and landing and immigration card were handed out just before landing i wa part way through completing mine when i heard the cabin crew minute to landing announcement the seat i wa sat in had a broken ife screen hinge and would swing back to the closed position fortunately the cabin wa not full which is a first for this route sadly the seat i then chose also had an ife issue too a minor one but annoying nonetheless third time lucky and hussar i must add that the choice of film were rather poor too the food would have been good save what wa on the main menu it wa a choice of chickpea tagine chicken and african stew which region of africa did that stew pertain to be from lord know anyway i opted for the chicken i must say i wa supremely underwhelmed it wa nothing short of a school dinner flavourless and unappetising,positive

british airway general onboard service in first are generally acceptable however the airline refuse to acknowledge that premium ground service should be added for paid first class passenger ground service such a special assistance for transfer that are so widely available on other carrier for their first class passenger are sorely lacking at ba ex lufthansa first class terminal and transfer at fra and others even a a gold executive club top tier member there is nothing available even when i call and request assistance on long haul first flight ex lhr to hkg that involve change in plane between t and t at lhr ba need to wake up and examine the overall first product the upgrade to the first cabin are also marginal packing narrow even on new a s seat in first put the airline at a huge disadvantage to other oneworld carrier who have a true first product ex cathay ha true suite in first wake up ba your premium fare paying customer are irate over this lack of first product amenity including full ground support especially upon special request for paying first passenger,positive

on a recent flight from johannesburg to london i wa shocked to find such cramped seating condition in the world traveller economy class section having not been able to secure an aisle seat which would have made minimal difference anyway i wa allocated a middle seat of like many other men and some woman i am over ft with long leg so the acute discomfort i experienced wa manifest from the start of the flight to the end about hour it wa difficult to stretch my leg and at time i had to stand in my seat to alleviate leg cramp it also caused me considerable back pain i did offer to swap seat with a lady in the adjacent aisle seat but she wa unwilling to do so that wa her prerogative so it became necessary to disturb her on a number of occasion to take a walk along the aisle in order to alleviate leg cramp the cabin staff were co operative in allowing me to use one of their seat in order to stretch my leg but had to return to mine during a period of turbulence reading very similar review it doe make me wonder if british airway will bother take any notice or continue to treat their passenger customer in this appalling fashion about year ago i experienced an appalling flight from buenos aire to london via british airway albeit for different reason and swore i would never use them again but i felt i would give them one more chance what a mistake the world s favourite airline don t make me laugh,negative

lhr zurich the trip got off to a good start a the north lounge wa not to busy and this made the whole experience relaxing rather than an endurance test which it is when it is busy had a nice early light lunch the aircraft wa a new a i like this plane it wa rammed end to end the plane had the new club europe seat and it reminded me how well ba seem to be in missing the opportunity to develop a product that could be really high in quality but isn t unless you are seated in row the leg room is appalling and the same a economy a with the old c e seat the centre seat between seat is a table quite why this is logical escape me because it seems to imply that if it suit ba they will at a whim seat three passenger and not two this wa a grand opportunity to stand out from the competition and clearly establish a comfortable wide c e seat at the same time justify the higher pricing it no wonder ba have very few if any travel industry award in the service they provide so frustrating i had another light lunch and a couple of gin and tonic which wa nice the fa were great flight left a few minute late but we whizzed over to zurich in minute which wa great the world s favourite airline try the world most frustrating airline,positive

i have been a loyal customer for the last year and have progressively seen the service cleanliness and interest in client satisfaction decline i just came back from a nyc lhr dubai trip and will not fly ba again several reason my seat in business class wa noticeably filthy crumb on the seat and hair on my pillow when i told the attendant she just fluffed the pillow and walked away i wa hounded for not filling out the breakfast form in minute the plane had not even taken off and told that i would not get breakfast i wa served raw chicken and when i expressed interest in another dish wa told that all the other passenger had eaten and that there were no more dish on the plane the dish wa taken away but no follow up or apology not even an extra bag of nut to ensure that i wa not hungry for the hr flight perhaps the most disturbing part of traveling with ba is that the staff are unapologetically arrogant disinterested and unapproachable and any response is a if they are doing you a favor a a customer paying nearly usd for a round trip ticket i shouldn t be afraid to speak to staff and highlight a dirty seat or food that is not cooked the seat on two of the leg were broken and my screen did not work on three of the leg there are plenty of other first class carrier out there that i will now become a customer of,negative

we travelled ba in business class lhr to vega before xmas and returned to lhr from san diego in january business class travel is a rare treat for u and i can t understand why ba persevere with this unique forward backwards facing seating layout to sit for hour face to face with a stranger is awful a is the lack of space created by the curved partition between the seat the cabin crew were great food wa below average and the inflight entertainment system abysmal poor choice and terrible picture quality outbound we were upstairs on a there were two attendant assisting only passenger and they did a good job and kept the two toilet clean given these circumstance this flight experience should have been fantastic however given the negative detailed above i would classify it a just about average we returned on a and my negative feeling are sadly the same other than we were stuck on the plane for min on landing awaiting bus to disembark,negative

return flight from lhr t to washington dulles iad in club world check in wa fine even if the layout of the t check in area isn t the most intuitive security wa efficient however the ba lounge wa overcrowded and noisy with minimal service and only basic comfort outbound flight on the a boarding wa rather chaotic due to the gate area being too small for such a large passenger compliment but the flight did push back on time the club world cabin on the upper deck could best be described a grey and functional it wa reasonably clean if not spotless but despite being a relatively new aircraft it did feel slightly shabby already the club world seat which wa forward facing and on the aisle wa comfortable enough the entertainment screen wa rather small and the choice of movie wasn t terribly extensive but everything apart from the in seat usb power socket wa working the general layout of the cabin wa terrible not only do window seat and middle row passenger have to step over the leg of aisle seat passenger to get to and from their seat but when the privacy screen between seat is lowered for take off landing and during meal service you find yourself staring rather disconcertingly close up into your neighbour face it make everything feel cramped and cheap meal were fine and the crew were polite and efficient overall i d rate the outbound experience a okay for a business class flight return flight experience wa far from okay my flight departing iad at pm wa cancelled hour prior to departure due to mechanical issue told that there were no club world seat on the earlier flight out of iad that night which i could just about make at a push and i would have to fly back in economy when i asked about the ba flight from baltimore bwi an hour later i wa told that yes there were club world seat available that evening so i asked to be rebooked onto that flight instead arriving at bwi check in i wa informed that unfortunately there actually weren t any club world seat available and i would have to fly back in world traveller plus the flight from bwi to lhr t wa on a rather old the cabin interior wa dated shabby and cramped with minimal overhead luggage storage world traveller plus seat were cramped and uncomfortable with tiny entertainment screen in flight food wa bland the crew were efficient but not terribly friendly flight left and arrived on time a a uk passport holder immigration at t wa quick baggage reclaim took longer but bag arrived within five minute of reaching the baggage hall,positive

my wife and i flew to barbados late november i had pre booked seat online to and fro but on both occasion the seat were already occupied when we boarded the flight attendant attitude towards this matter on the return journey wa at best rude unhelpful and indifferent asking for a drink wa a complete siege after hour into the flight they claim that they had run out of galley drink supply on our return trying to obtain a refund for the pre booked seat proved difficult overall b a ha got to rank a one of the worst airline to travel with staff with generally poor and indifferent attitude penny pinching which is bordering on mean and poor legroom sad to say this b a but emirate and other airline put our national airline to absolute shame,negative

bangkok to london heathrow sep on this flight british airway stinted on everything i don t mind a frugal airline a long a the fare is cheap british airway is not cheap a soon a we were in the air the temperature plummeted everyone had their airline blanket over them there were not enough steward stewardess forty minute before the welcome on board drink and no small snack not even a small packet of nut seatback tv did not work in the section i wa on and the man next to me had to move to another seat the seatbacks should be checked before the flight however eventually they did work a small number of film tv show i have never heard of and no game option first meal very frugal second meal no salad and no bread roll and creamer even for tea whatever the quality of the meal serving creamer cancel out any pretence of quality snack we had to wait and when they were available there wa a limited amount british airway even ran out of beer ba hasa system of paying to book a certain seat they don t miss a trick i resent having to pay to book a certain seat the flight wa expensive but it had a good time slot and no stopover never again,negative

flying from lgw to mco on a compared to last year the cabin wa clean wide variety of food and beverage quality wa good ba is far behind a lot of airline in business class the seat is small if you are over foot tall staff ok they don t go out of their way it seems that they are just doing their job you don t see them between meal they need to step up their game i don t think ba is a star airline i would only recommend because of direct flight,positive
lhr helsinki in business class i happened to fly on this flight a i booked a flight to shanghai with finnair in business and ba are a oneworld partner although the cabin crew were very attentive i feel that club europe is not worth the extra money considering the length of flight and extra service provided the aircraft wa a brand new a with leather seat but there wa no extra legroom in the club europe section the seat were the same a in the economy section the only difference being that the middle seat is not in use there is a movable partition separating the two cabin presumably to offer maximum flexibility for the airline hot towel were provided before takeoff but no welcome drink the generous bar service started shortly after take off followed by a rather disappointing meal considering that it wa a h lunchtime flight all that wa on offer wa a cold meat platter with a salad and a bread roll i have had better service in economy on ba short hall flight in the late s furthermore i recently flew on a china eastern airline domestic flight of similar length on business class on a new a and the seat were in a abreast configuration with much more legroom and i wa served with a hot meal there wa no personal entertainment the overhead screen showed the moving map for the duration of the flight i do like ba but if you are flying short hall and are considering club europe i suggest saving your money and flying in the economy cabin these low rating reflect my expectation of business class and not the airline overall,positive
man lhr lax flew manchester to lax via heathrow on christmas day in club world on the a check in and boarding were extremely smooth at manchester and the lounge wa also quiet due to the fact it wa a holiday upon arrival lhr wa much busier so much so that we struggled to find a seat in the south lounge when it came time to board the aircraft it wa quite frankly carnage there didn t seem to be any real system and we had to fight through the crowd just to be able to get in the long line for club passenger the downside of such a big aircraft is the number of passenger even in club world once on board it wa a fairly standard offering club world on ba is pretty consistent across all aircraft i now find seat and service were all fine not exceptional but acceptable my one main gripe u that we were seated on the lower deck seat a and b and on our side of the plane there wa only one tiny bathroom which often led to a line the other side of the aircraft had two bathroom but getting to them meant going all the way round the galley kitchen and cabin staff in there were often busy working or just hanging out and it seemed that they weren t too keen on being disturbed whilst there s no doubt the a is a quieter aircraft i feel it size and the number of passenger take something away from the level of service which you d expect to be high given the price paid for club world ticket,negative

i have not travelled with ba for almost year a a result of moving to asia and using carrier like af sq emirate i flew premium from lhr to mia on a and horrified to see that the premium product ha not changed in the last year ba have quite an ageing fleet now when compared to most european and asian carrier and it really show the entertainment screen wa absolutely tiny and the charging point is still that ridiculous adapter for which you have to pay an arm and a leg so pleased i found mine from year back ba must go and have a look at the af premium product for a wake up call the food wa okay nothing to rave about and perfectly satisfactory service onboard seems friendly and efficient however the state of the uniform of some of the staff wa shocking not sure if it a case of poor quality material or lack of attention to appearance i do remember the strap line ba the world favourite airline but sadly they have slipped quite a long way back,positive
ba jan lhr jfk first t is great for the first class experience with check in security and straight into the concorde room the lounge and spa facility are a great refuge while flying especially the dining room the ha more room in the cabin than the flight to london which i appreciated especially when it came to my bed seat a is private and roomy it wa a full flight so service wa efficient and friendly if not a little rushed overall the service wa at the great ba standard what wa lacking wa the meal wa lacking the freshness and taste which wa disappointing there wa major hr delay in planing at jfk which wa not ba s fault but really made this flight much longer than it should had been i would fly ba first again for the service stylish cabin and overall comfort,positive

washington iad to heathrow on christmas day returning january th i find myself nodding in agreement to many of the review written here by other passenger regarding the slippage in standard of ba especially considering what they once were having arrived at dulles in good time to check in there were paper notice on the desk to say that check in would not open til pm okay it wa christmas day but all other carrier both domestic and international were open the airport wa busy and i along with other passenger had to sit and wait for hr until staff arrived the same wa true of the lounge which having made it through security wa not open til pm again the other airline lounge were open having eventually gained access the lounge wa great and the bar and dinner service i wa on a sleeper flight were very good with plentiful drink and fine food we boarded on time and my seat wa upstairs on the a this aircraft is of course huge but the club world seat is a many have noted much less comfortable than the boeing or it is narrower and whilst okay for seating very hard and difficult to find the right position for sleeping ba seem to have missed a great opportunity here to do something really special along the line of some of the asian carrier the crew were very good friendly and attentive breakfast before we landed wa very average the bacon roll were dried out and are always a challenge to eat yoghurt and fruit were the alternative which i went for check in for the return journey wa lamentable at heathrow terminal dedicated club world position had queue around ten people deep and moved terribly slowly not all the position were open and passenger were visibly irritated the journey other than the cramped seat issue again wa fine with another good crew and food and drink i have always recommended ba to friend and would like to keep doing so but feel that especially given the high and rising cost of paying for club these day ba need to adopt a slightly less take attitude and give a little more especially when it come to spending avios which they are very keen for one to accrue but reticent to allow one to use,positive
lgw mla for some crazy reason i still fly british airway and pay for club europe following this trip i have come to my sens apart from a berlin trip already paid for in may they can say goodbye to my business travel this wa an airbus previously owned by bmi it wa not difficult to work that out a it wa still showing the bmi banner inside the plane wa never used for business all the seat were a miserable inch pitch there wa not even a curtain dividing club and economy just how ba think they are going to get away with this type of robbery for much longer i don t know unless there is an alternative carrier offering proper club facility then it low cost airline for me around europe,negative

recently completed a round trip lgw barcelona flying out i wa in economy a bit tight but service wa very friendly only complaint would be that drink took a long time to be served in fact by the time they reached the back it wa well past an hour into the flight and long after the sandwich had been handed out a second drink or coffee tea service would have been appreciated flew club europe on inbound jan flight and although i m not a seasoned business class traveller i thought it wa impeccable for the modest premium paid had the old layout so no complaint about seat comfort not sure if i d say the same with the newer seating arrangement from what i ve read on this forum crew member serving the club cabin could not have been better everything wa served with the most gracious of smile and the mood in the cabin wa relaxed but convivial food and drink very good and appropriate for time of day and length of flight miro lounge in barcelona top notch will definitely try to book club in the future,positive
we flew from gatwick to jamaica in november check in wa easy and very quick and we were soon in the lounge the lounge a usual wa comfortable but with a very poor selection of food a we were there around i had hoped to have a hot breakfast but in the end the only hot dish available wa porridge which i didn t fancy so we settled for tea and cake the departure gate wa not the biggest and a a result it all got a bit messy with the staff trying coral the cw passenger in to a separate area to board first on board most thing were ok and the staff are very efficient and helped to make the experience a good one the return from kingston wa pretty much the same although the check in wa slower however this wa compensated by an excellent lounge club kingston that served nice hot and cold snack and then escorted you to the departure area a usual the crew turned the light down a soon a dinner wa cleared away but i did manage to read for a while and then sleep for to hour overall quite good and based on this experience i would recommend this product,positive

i have used british airway over a number of year for work and leisure trip non exclusively and must say i have noted a gradual but continued decrease in service quality on a recent return flight from johannesburg travelling with an infant we were delayed for over hour the way in which the delay wa handled wa terrible minimal staff meant it took three plus hour to get checked in to a hotel then trying to arrange the return minimising waiting time for the little one took hour with two staff serving passenger with no concern for customer tried calling head office and they were less helpful than the booking agent my intention is to avoid where possible and in many case they are cheaper alternative,negative

i flew to toronto from manchester via t heathrow on dec returning on jan i have no complaint about the inflight experience which wa generally very good although i am not sure that premium economy is really worth the money what i found completely annoying wa the lack of air bridge both on departure and arrival at t heathrow we were herded on to bus like cattle closely resembling the tube at rush hour and then had to climb steep step into the aircraft no easy feat with heavy hand luggage and duty free are there not enough gate with air bridge at t why is this necessary i will be flying to toronto again in september but i am not sure it will be with ba if this situation persists,positive

lgw to tfs in club europe disappointing that ba ha downgraded it ce service to such an extent that it is not really worth paying the extra for short haul too little leg room now such that new seat are no different from economy yes the middle seat is not occupied but what both my partner and i would like is additional leg room not good enough to pay the extra and then have to sit at an angle to fit into the seat new seat are uncomfortable a well lunch service reminiscent of economy food tray of the s too cabin crew doing their best with a full club cabin ce clearly still popular for the moment even with revised cabin layout but for how much longer can no longer recommend ba for a four hour short haul although good time keeping such a shame that ba ha allowed this to happen think again ba,positive

lhr sfo club world i find myself nodding to the negative yet factual feedback of others regarding ba s premium product online check in and boarding were smooth and uneventful that is it whoever designed the club world seat need to have their head examined the board that signed off on the product should be fired the seat wa narrowed with no space to put your drink without lowering the dining table that is just plain stupid having to step over another pax to get out of your seat if seated in window is another stupid concept the design offer absolutely no privacy if seated in the aisle the food wa okay nothing to brag about and definitely not at the level expected to see in premium class compared to the like of air france or lufthansa entertainment selection were poor but better than klm and the screen not of good size fly crew were ok i ordered the beef and the pax next to me did the same even though my order wa first my neighbour got the last order fair enough ended up with turkey roulade wa ok the crew were apologetic but not attentive having flew other carrier i can honestly say theirs little enthusiasm shown by the crew which is a shame had an opportunity to look at the st class menu to be frank any carrier who doe not offer caviar s in it first class cabin in my view is out with the time making this observation because in month i will be travelling to mexico and the price comparison between lufthansa and ba are not far apart former slightly less but i suspect flying lufthansa is likely to be more enjoyable than ba based on the experienced of this journey will see if the return flight might tilt the view to the i would not pay the published c or f class fare on ba the product line doe not equate to the price ba wa the waitrose and is now between tesco or asda,positive

a club world hkg lhr overall a very good flight with ba i had a good window seat with direct aisle access and fortunately the cabin wa not particularly busy so the toilet did not cause any disturbance i find the seat very comfortable for eating lounging and sleeping although a mattress topper would make sleeping even more comfortable the half folding table is great when you just have a drink or your phone charging but of course this ha to become the table when a meal service start so it is a shame there isn t a separate table the inflight entertainment is excellent i do not understand any criticism of this a the screen is large and good quality and there is a large choice of film and tv the catering however continues to be poor with ba while the menu sound great and dish generally look good they often fall down when you actually eat them a this wa an overnight flight the meal were designed lighter and the champagne and canap s starter sounded perfect they were however limp tasteless bite sized thing this to me is ba s weakest area and they really need to improve their catering offering in order to compete with other airline service from cabin crew were very good friendly and efficient and always calling me by my name wherever they see me in the cabin,positive
premium economy pricey but of questionable value having flown ba long haul twice previously in economy we decided to pay extra round trip for world traveller plus all we got for the money wa legroom terrific because i m but not worth the price the trick to airline comfort and there is no such thing unless you re flying business or first class on a long haul flight is to book the section of in economy and hope that the two people beside you and your travel companion are smart enough to figure out that the quickest way to the aisle is to go across one person not two let s face it all you want from a long haul flight are comfortable seat and the new generation of thinner seat receives mixed review and acceptable food you expect safety and timely arrival which depends on weather and other variable not controlled by the airline,positive

british airway are not interested in providing normal business class comfort and cuisine or even lounge on some route the cancun route and the nassau route i have flown recently show this clearly a they are presumably are not bothered with little or no competition at all this saddens me that they have made a clear decision that on holiday type route they will provide the absolute minimum on everything one example that show how pathetic it ha become with cutback out of many problem i encountered on these route is that the food wa so awful on the cancun flight recently that we merely asked for cheese and biscuit in business class to be told that we could only have one packet of two biscuit each a ba only allocated one packet per person the staff all agree that this wa pathetic no lounge at both these airport either and queuing of business class and economy all together no attempt to really show you paid extra for your ticket,negative

flew return lhr to lax on the a condition of the aircraft is good a the aircraft is new ba had first business and economy on the main deck and business premium economy and economy on the upper deck this wa good a it avoided the vast space which could make the cabin look like cattle class the food service wa acceptable and ha not changed much except for the smaller portion from which i first flew with ba about year ago service wa delivered in a professional and timely manner the downside wa the seat design ba is trying to fit a remote control video screen tray table and storage space all on the seat back this make the tray table and video screen far too small back to size that i experienced back in the s this made the travel experience felt like cattle class a the seat dimension is typical economy seat size all other airline have improved the travel experience by improving the economy seat design the worst experience wa on the return leg when a passenger absolutely refused to put his seat upright during the dinner service and this wa after i asked him repeatedly this resulted in my tray sloping down and the dinner tray and tray table hitting my stomach the cabin crew just shrug me off when i asked him to ask the gentleman to put up his seat for just minute come on there is a big difference between good service not upsetting customer and just avoiding difficult situation,positive
jfk lhr b brilliant flight namely because of the flight attendant they were really friendly not hurried in what they were doing and seemed genuine the product on this older wasn t great it wa nice having the extra room and smaller cabin in premium economy but the tv screen wa tiny and you could tell it wa just an out of date aircraft and needed updating food wa absolutely excellent beautiful lamb cutlet and beef cheek best food i ve had on an aircraft quick flight reasonably comfortable and would definitely fly again,positive
i cannot believe that ba call their plane from austin to london a dreamliner i m sitting in their so called club world which is the equivalent to american business class and this plane is awful there is no room to put anything at all everything and i mean everything go in storage you are literally looking straight at the person next to you attendant are rude don t waste your money while it nice to go non stop between austin and london this will be the last time i ever take this flight,negative
am lhr jnb and cpt lhr am in club between amsterdam and london is just wonderful love the front cabin a to jnb this wa a late departure i could see from the lounge the a arrive at the stand some minute prior to boarding obviously arriving late from another destination and even though it doesn t require a lot of inside knowledge to see that such a plane can not be turned around in minute however ba did not feel there would be a delay until it called all it s premium passenger from the lounge and had them lined up in separate lane in front of the counter then announcing a delay of then then minute how to get your most appreciated customer furious never hear so many complaint on an airline even before the flight started terrible ground management not a good start upperdeck club seating is absolutely wonderful and this plane is so quiet that you can hear everything never realized how much snoring is going on at night first time i had to use earplug food wa just terrible and how ba get away with having pepper and salt in the cheapest of the cheapest sachet just baffle me the flight to jo burg wa obviously done by the more senior crew who have incredible charm wit and the most entertaining sense of humor that opposed to the new crew on the way back from cape town old with spacious seating all fine crew stressed running all the time no manner no sense of class and definitely no sense of humor food wa slightly better on this long flight but way below any other european carrier i flew it wa my first time in club on ba i love the seat very comfortable for sleeping there is a lack of space to put your stuff but other than that a really nice product ba lounge definitely stand out in the level of catering food transfer at lhr t wa quick and easy but terminal itself is a tacky shopping mall and how so soon after being delivered a new half of it wa blocked for remodelling my return to amsterdam on a new a wa great good breakfast and seating is fine,positive
travelled jfk lhr late november the concorde room very nice indeed food not that good for once seat k fine comfortable enough but no space at all for small thing even the wardrobe had no storage space just room for the coat and shoe below this compare with american airline business class which had essentially the same seat load of storage space and good privacy aa business class is equivalent to ba first class the service wa fantastic a always with ba cup of tea excellent and breakfast good toiletry bag wa fine with all the item needed toilet a bit naff for first class value for money simply because the deal i got wa really good ba always do deal late november otherwise it would have been poor value however aa are preferred ba do not have wifi,positive

phoenix to london outbound a wonderful and enjoyable experience the problem we had started on our return flight home we boarded the plane and were disappointed to find out that we were in the old style first class after being in the new cabin on the way out the old configuration is very run down and there wa a rip in the seat i wa attempting to work but when i went to plug in my laptop battery i found that there wa no adapter for me to use since i could no longer work i decided to put a movie on the tiny screen in the old first class wa just pathetic the flight attendant did their absolute best to make up for the issue and i give them high mark for trying a hard a they possibly could to accommodate me i decided to walk to the back and visit a friend who wa also on the flight you can imagine my surprise when i saw him sitting in business class with a tv screen bigger than mine a plug for his laptop and a new seat at this point it became obvious to me that the rest of the cabin both coach and business class had been upgraded it doesn t make sense to me just when we thought it could not get any worse we landed in phoenix to face another issue we waited minute for our bag before being told that our luggage wa still in london we ve flown on this flight before and had the same issue of our luggage not being on the plane the difference is that we were informed before landing that our baggage hadn t made it and that they would have it delivered directly to our home well this time nobody informed u so we stood there waiting for minute at the baggage claim before we were told,positive
lhr to ist in economy excellent i thought it wa a new a but fa told me it wa not new it wa refurbished well done ba on a good re design new lighting seat clever seat back storage etc i believe they ve reduced the economy seat pitch but the design is such that you don t notice dinner wa served on this evening flight a very tasty chicken curry with cheese cracker and chocolate mousse desert a very decent meal for a hour flight in economy fa were courteous and efficient the only negative wa security at lhr t where there wa a long delay because of installation of new machine and security alert that morning,positive
lhr hel club europe hel lhr economy club ha improved a lot great service from staff greeting you by your name however the food wa just cold cut and salad dessert thin slice of fruit the new seat are not very comfortable but i sat in the first row so had ample leg room not sure if worth a full fare but a a part mile ticket it wa enjoyable the return in economy wa fine again the new seat are not comfortable much prefer the old one although the cabin doe look very nice in economy you were served a sandwich and drink including beer i fly the same route regularly in finnair and ba is a superior service the flight attendant did a good job not overly friendly but quite attentive the lounge at lhr terminal is ok but breakfast wa pretty bad egg muffin with no taste at all do recommend club europe but only when not paying top fare,positive
bgi lgw premium economy august silver tier status older plane with older version of ba pe seat adequate leg room though cabin crew barely visible for the hour flight and quite short tempered when they served dinner and breakfast on ba website pe meal advertised a being a choice of two dish off the business menu we were definitely served an economy meal for dinner which wa fairly average breakfast before we landed in lgw consisted of a hard cold croissant with jam and fresh orange with tea coffee at the end of an hour flight this wa really disappointing and i would have been disappointed with this in economy never mind pe when i asked a flight attendant about this i wa treated abysmally overall it is not worth paying extra for pe taking into account the poor standard of meal but especially the lack of courtesy and basic manner shown by cabin crew,negative

i feel a though i am the only traveller in the world who ha not enjoyed the experience on the dreamliner i ve travelled with ba for the past year when on business i travel business class and when on personal travel it varies between economy and club depending on distance and budget this year i travelled to toronto on vacation and were assigned economy seat on the new dreamliner we chose not to upgrade seat a the dreamliner blurb gushed about seat space how foolish we were at just and respectively we are not in any way shape or form giant but the absolute honest truth is we were squashed in tight the restricted space wa possibly not so much the leg room but the seat width but letting the table down for food drink wa snug outside of the seat space issue everything else wa superb inflight entertainment equipment wa familiar easy to use boarding in uk and toronto wa smooth and helpful ground staff were always visible and proactive in offering and helping passenger entertainment itself wa varied and instantly accessed food wa reasonable drink were available with meal and upon request crew were unfailingly polite professional and impeccable,positive

yvr lhr am an uneventful journey with ba but their boeing from vancouver wa a flashback to the s dated interior with cold colour old seat that recline practically into your face making the already cramped space even more uncomfortable you could also occasionally feel the person s knee pushing into the back of your own seat the in flight entertainment wa equally old with a blurry screen and limited choice of entertainment the cabin crew were courteous and friendly arrival and transfer in ba s terminal wa very smooth and relaxing the connecting flight to amsterdam wa a modern airbus a with bright and comfortable interior seating unless ba revamp their ageing fleet consider fly with virgin air canada or even air transat for the vancouver london route,positive
have just completed four flight with british airway all in economy and all long haul two were on the a one on the b and the fourth on a refurbished b so they all had the new seat i find it comfortable although never seem to get the headrest really right the seat are narrow and on busy flight your neighbour can be rather close at m the leg room and spacing wa fine although some seat do have restriction with the entertainment system the and are very quiet which make the toilet sound nosier should you be near them on the upper deck of the the overhead bin space in the back economy section is woefully inadequate i m sure it wa never planned for economy seating food ok my special meal came a ordered flight on time or early and staff helpful and pleasant heathrow t can be a problem depending on when you travel and the main section a can get very busy a people wait to learn the gate detail,positive
british airway for some reason wa incapable of seating me next to my husband during our recent hour flight we made the reservation many month ago attempted several time to select seat and were told we could not do so in advance but needed to wait until we got to the airport this wa our first time flying with them and every other airline we have ever flown ha allowed u to sit together it is usually assumed that if we are married and making the reservation together at the same time using one credit card and paying a lot for the trip that we actually want to sit next to each other when we tried to change our seat to be together all representative said being separated wa typical which is strange because then you have a plane full of family that have been physically separated for no apparent reason while it s always fun to meet new stranger we will not be flying with british airway again,positive
lca lhr in club europe decided to check a bag in to see how t baggage arrival performed pleasant check in experience security marred by a family carrying unrevealed bottle and liquid that wa a field day for the security staff and simply a pain for the rest of u queuing behind them the cyprus airway lounge whilst much better than it predecessor is still third rate with a poor selection of food and wine and on this occasion overcrowded wandered to the gate in good time for boarding to be confronted by a flotilla of wheelchair bound passenger all of whom get ultra priority boarding so boarding took longer despite the fact that whilst business class wa almost full economy wasn t on board service wa ok hot towel no menu drink and a course meal salad main dessert or cheese but somehow the service wa not a impressive a my outbound queue longer to get through the e passport channel than the regular immigration route but at least arriving in the baggage hall our bag wa on the carousel all in all a satisfactory flight,positive

lhr hkg b club world i wa lucky enough to book a window seat at the back of the club world cabin which meant that i had direct aisle access without stepping over someone else s foot or them mine and my meal did not need to be passed over the person next to me i found the seat very comfortable and while it is slightly narrower than others it ha a lot of flexibility with the foot stool and the reclining option the backward forward facing seat is not ideal although did not upset me a much a others a i wa travelling with a friend the potentially awkward intimacy wa not an issue ife wa excellent with a large good quality screen and an extensive library of film and tv food wa fairly disappointing possibly hindered by an hour delay on departure although really they should be resilient to that drink and service were both very good british airway offer a very efficient and professional service although it is not always overtly friendly personally i like this but it could be seen a a negative depending on people expectation gallery lounge in lhr t wa excellent peaceful and comfortable with a good selection of drink and reasonable food overall it wa a solid product and one which i look forward to flying again ba do need to improve their catering on board in order to compete better with other airline,positive

nbo lhr club world and lhr bos in economy generally a pleasant and comfortable experience i have difficulty reconciling our positive experience with the negative comment about flight attendant in other post here a we boarded in nairobi the purser welcomed u by name and said how pleased they were to have u back again on ba before take off from london a flight attendant offered the third person in our row a different seat leaving my wife and me with a vacant seat between u in all case attendant were helpful cheerful and efficient obviously in club world staff have more time to spend with passenger with the exception of the late night dinner out of nairobi we were impressed with the meal selection and quality flight were on time checked baggage arrived in good condition agree that having to pay to reserve seat if you are not of sufficient one world status is disappointing generally we remain very pleased with british air certainly the best one world option to europe and beyond from boston,positive

on past experience i chose ba for our long haul return flight to south america from the uk not until i got to the payment stage did i realise that of the flight only one short flight to madrid wa actually on a ba plane the others were with iberia airway i understand that flight operator have to partner with other agency but you would expect then that they would adhere to standard expected of the original operator standard were very poor no inflight entertainment on a and hour flight poor food and on the last leg of the journey we were even expected to pay for our food what is this a budget airline at full blown price again on this last leg the toilet weren t flushing so at oyr destination they were almost full my advice would be check who you re actually flying with,negative

flew with my wife lhr jnb ba on an a october st and back jnb lhr ba november th in business class british airway ha invented high density business class or sardine business class abreast on the main deck and abreast on the upper deck this cabin configuration is very strange to be fair the seat itself is comfortable enough to be able to sleep but it is so narrow that you have almost nothing to store any belonging you are facing your neighbour and if you seat on a middle seat the access to the aisle is not easy at all you have no view outside except if you have a window seat you have the impression of flying in a submarine on the other hand if you are a little bit claustrophobic fly the competitor the ife is ok the screen is large enough but the film selection is under average the service is good food and beverage ok to summarize a long a ba proposes very attractive fare that wa the case i will fly again ba if not i will fly the competitor,positive

lax lhr the flight started badly with the lounge facility or lack of at lax there is no first class lounge anymore and worst still it a communal business first facility shared by ba qantas and cathay pacific two hour before my flight it wa a zoo rammed with around passenger from flight the food and beverage wa to a very high standard there wa no separated boarding line for first passenger flight left on time and dinner wa an ordinary affair a poached salmon starter wa neither here or there luke warm soup a rather nice but not exceptional italian style chicken dish all served with cheap canteen style cutlery long gone is the nice silver plated cutlery they used to offer wine were fine turn down bed service reminded me of why i don t like the new ba first class seat the silliest aspect ha to be that you either have a seat or a bed and no adjustable foot rest in bed mode and mainly thanks to the design of the centre console housing the table the bed is to narrow i am tall and not overweight it s very awkward and uncomfortable ba in old first i am sure use to give you a foldable mattress now they don t you get a thin duvet this make the bed incredible hard and during turbulence it a hard uncomfortable to ride i don t think i slept more than an hour in the whole flight the tight confines of the compartment mean you have to be a gymnast to get in and out when in bed mode this fare is sometimes a much a one way and it s not worth it what amazes me in the competitive world that ba operate is that they don t seem to look at the competition they trumpet they are the best and yet they are not mind you on the lax route the only alternative is aa and they have little idea on quality in first class when i look at what sia emirate the best in my view and etihad offer ba do not come close ba often charge more than anyone else for a frequently inferior product in fact over the last ten year the price have sky rocketed and the quality and standard have sky rocketed a well downwards,positive

i recently flew on british airway long haul on a flight from philadelphia to new delhi havinh not having travelled with british airway for around a decade i had been a huge fan of british airway in the past and wa very curious to see how their inflight product and entertainment had changed in that time i also wa curious to see heathrow s new terminal british airway s overall product ha improved in that time on the first leg from philadelphia to london i wa very happy to notice the new seat with excellent comfort with adjustable headrest and new audio video on demand avod entertainment system i had been travelling with noise cancelling headphone which made the experience a thoroughly enjoyable one inflight entertainment system is sophisticated and i enjoyed their world music section in particular the asian vegetarian meal wa of a high standard for the most part my only criticism in this area wa that on the second meal breakfast we only were served a fruit platter and had to ask for the croissant everyone else were given in addition i found the chapati on the delhi london sector to be hard a rock otherwise the meal were very good terminal is a gem of an airport but the true highlight of the journey wa on the london philadelphia sector when i had the opportunity to fly on the dreamliner the plane is a marvel the window are huge dimmable by button too the bathroom are larger than usual and the flight wa very smooth additionally the legroom on the dreamliner is impressive an improvement on the b and finally a word about the cabin attendant their level of friendliness varies from person to person but for the most part they represent the best tradition of british hospitality informal politeness all in all i wa happy with my ba trip and they continue to perform a one of my favourite airline,positive

osl lhr in business ba ha over the last few year put less priority on oslo and sa today ha a better offering ba is the only flag carrier in oslo that doe not offer fast track security the menzies ground staff are doing their best but doe not have any authority to help when thing go wrong particularly the evening flight are very often delayed due to late incoming aircraft from lhr and i have several time been an hour or more delayed and lost intercontinental flight a a result the de icing procedure is also much slower than on sa the lounge in oslo is nice but not magnificent ba ha better service in business class than sa with better food and free middle seat you do however pay much more than for sa plus the crew wa friendly and did their best on my last flight but seemed badly trained forgot to serve bread with the meal and spent a lot of time chatting in the galley one sometimes miss the old well trained ba staff sa also very often offer internet access on the london flight which is a plus,positive

ba jfk to heathrow october the outward flight had been so awful so the return surely could not be any worse how wrong i wa arrived at business check in at jfk terminal no staff at desk boarding pas printed at machine but had to wait nearly twenty minute to check luggage agent wa rude and unhelpful onto the ba lounge sagging shabby seat and no food except crisp on asking the receptionist where the food wa i wa told passenger normally use the much advertised pre boarding supper facility asked when this opened and wa told it wa not operating eventually some badly cut sandwich and lump of cheese with cracker appeared no hot food wa available two hour before departure the flight wa posted a four minute late no further information wa posted when i asked for an update thirty minute before scheduled take off i wa told there would be an announcement shortly eventually a barely audible announcement came that the plane wa now boarding the departure board had not been updated so premium passenger were forced to shuffle along with those in the main cabin onboard after presenting my boarding pas i wa given a grunted down there with no indication a to which side of the plane i wa seated on reflection late boarding may have been a blessing i lost count of the time i wa knocked by oversized and heavy hand luggage eventually the safety demonstration wa played on the ife system the sound wa inaudible surely a safety hazard similarly all announcement from the cockpit went unheard we took off one hour and fifteen minute late with no explanation given for the delay the wine selection wa very limited on the flight a wa the menu two choice of main course and only one dessert i asked if i could have the advertised ice cream snack for desert to be told there wa none on board food wa barely edible service wa poor the cabin crew seemed intent on throwing tray round a fast a possible my salad wa served with desert which i did not want on the tray the main course wa overcooked beef near raw vegetable i wa made to feel a nuisance when i asked for a second glass of wine the narrow seat converted to a narrow and not very comfortable bed other carrier provide mattress and duvet ba seem to think a tacky blanket will do the whole service ha been downgraded to the standard i would expect in economy class the nicieties that used to mark business flight have been lost in the pursuit of profit given that ba charge far more that their competitor for this route i wa thoroughly disappointed i will not use any ba flight again if there is an alternative available,negative

a barcelona to heathrow business no announcement for boarding so missed any chance of priority boarding why pay extra for something you are not going to get cabin service slow over an hour until meal served had to ask for another drink a only small bottle given they also ran out of the main choice meal and the cabin wa not full had second choice meal and this wa cold to fly to serve i think not terrible service for an airline that is supposed to pride itself on service,positive
ba heathrow to boston b there wa nothing at all to commend this flight i have had better comfort and service on low cost carrier the seat must be the narrowest in class for any major airline the business lounge at heathrow is not well signed and awkwardly placed at the top of escalator at in the morning the table were overflowing with used crockery and waste food when staff did appear they did a very cursory clearing job never once in two hour did i see any of the sticky table being wiped down on boarding i wa neither shown to my seat nor addressed by name a i have been on other airline when i asked for assistance in putting my hand luggage in the overhead locker i wa told in no uncertain term staff were not allowed to help again i have always had help on business flight on other airline in the air the level of discomfort rose a those in the inside seat were forced to jump over my out stretched leg and cabin staff leant over me to serve the inside seat the level of service could not remotely be considered acceptable for the price paid add in poor food and ife and decision to avoid ba flight in future wa made for me,negative

lgw to cmb via mle and return sept oct a a british citizen you desperately want to like ba but they do make it very difficult to do so the recent documentary a very british airline whetted our appetite that perhaps a commitment to service may have returned to ba particularly in the long haul premium cabin sadly on all the leg the cabin service wa totally indifferent without any effort to do more than the bare minimum attendant chewing gum no smile everything wa all too much effort the only time the crew showed any animation wa when talking to each other adequate is about the best description but it could have been so much better without any cost except a bit of effort,positive

class refitted with the new world traveller and wt plus cabin lhr del lhr very disappointed on the outbound flight the food choice wa gone before they reached the th row of the economy cabin meaning that myself and the rest of the cabin had to have the second choice meal second choice for good reason it wa a truly unpleasant tray of food the real issue is the introduction of possibly the largest entertainment equipment box in the floor space i have ever seen it literally take up half of the floor and prevents you from stretching both leg out i don t know if this is exclusive to the refitted b s but it is certainly a side effect of the new ife and isn t there on the the older cabin the box seems to be under every window seat on both side of the cabin i really don t understand what the cabin designer were thinking allowing this box to take up so much of the space that is already so precious they could have at least rounded off the corner it seems rushed and last minute this mean that i am now avoiding ba when booking a trip if they are operating the b on the desired route bye bye executive club silver,positive
booked a seat in world traveller ecomomy for an extra each way this wa to get an exit seat with legroom and a window seat wa advertised a window exit yes it wa an exit seat but there wa no window at the seat the slide raft box protruded from the exit door greatly reducing the amount of space for legroom seat beside me wa empty but a guy wa quickly moved into it when he asked for it despite u having to pay each way for these seat stewardess were friendly but service wa almost non existent the child portion chicken dinner wa in no way filling wa hungry throughout whole flight no food or snack offered until about hour before landing when i wa given a cheese roll with no butter or mayonnaise completely dry and unappetising,negative
without being completely detrimental to ba i have found the airline ha become tired and lacking in customer service from the cabin crew a i fly economy class at company expense this class of traveler is viewed by the cabin staff a something to be tolerated until the end of the flight the aircraft that i fly on from london to mexico city are these aircraft have obviously travelled many hundred of thousand of air mile the seat are mostly very worn and hard a to hour flight leaf one with a very numb part of the anatomy toilet seat are more often than not insecure or broken food offered is now without a menu you get what you are given or go without from two choice the famous ba breakfast is now no more just a sandwich or a frozen roll the inflight entertainment is often non functional and regular resetting of the system is quite normal sound quality is always very bad my comment are not directed at just one flight or one aircraft only i have seen this deterioration over quite a few year whilst i fully appreciate economy and money saving is today s norm major airline to my mind should think customer satisfaction at all level not just the first class and business class customer i have seen other airline achieve and maintain very high standard in today s economic world of airline travel but sadly ba seem to be trailing to an embarrassing extent,negative
travelled to cyprus from gatwick in economy a thought this would be fine a use them internally in uk a we are tall thought seat pitch would be same a home wrong dreadful flight in extremely cramped cabin my husband wa virtually trapped by the seat in front and the only saving grace wa that we had a spare seat in between u otherwise i think we would have been standing most of the way poor service and truly awful food if you could call it food wrap and small roll with nice chocolate dessert wrap wa soggy and inedible roll dry and hardly had any filling only one round of drink then tea etc with food on a flight of hour really smelly toilet and air conditioning poor aircraft old and just a bad flight experience took off late too have travelled in considerably better flight with charter airline and following this experience will not be patronising ba again in economy once we have suffered the return flight have gone business class which is good but economy is dreadful,negative

route heathrow toronto first class daytime flight check in security the former wa smooth friendly and efficient the latter wa very poor on the basis that ba make no special provision for security with f class passenger either at their own hub heathrow terminal or any destination f class passenger are not escorted which i consider to be a significant shortfall when clearing immigration and boarding flight lounge flagship lounge concorde room is quiet elegant reasonably well staffed and conveniently located after security good food in civilised portion served in the restaurant and a good selection of wine ife and amenity the tv is fairly decent even on the refurbed s comfortable seat bed with decent bedding and pjs good leg room which i notice at practical sized amenity kit which is fairly well stocked food decent food and well presented selection is sufficient but no special option available pre boarding crew generally affable crew who were professional not the fastest of service in comparison to other f product crew and captain introduced themselves to a number of passenger which sits between those airline where all passenger are chatted with and those who don t i would say ba have the right approach in that crew seem to visually assess whether a passenger look like they would invite a social conversation rather than imposing it anyway,positive
ba pek to lhr business class b first time i have flown ba long haul and in view of the many unhappy traveller on this site i wa keen to see for myself i can honestly say i have never experienced such a dreadful flight antiquated and filthy plane is an experience i would never want to make again the seating in business class downstairs is a disgrace i wa unlucky enough to have the aisle seat g which turned in to a flat bed so narrow my body and i am small wa over the main aisle when asleep being continuously bumped and pushed absolutely no privacy in this seat and every one coming out of the toilet and standing and waiting the kitchen area could see my every move completely unacceptable no mattress and only a small blanket there is nowhere to put even a pair of glass or a bottle of water once the tray table wa put up necessary to sleep to get to the centre seat where my husband wa a dirty plastic window had to be slid down and hot beverage and food had to be passed across the whole time encroaching on my personal space what there wa of it my husband said the middle seat trapped passenger in and getting out involved stepping over people extremely difficult for short people the whole design of the business class seat is very uncomfortable and seriously flawed the food wa badly presented and unappetising the pa system from the flight deck wa inaudible i could not hear the captain in the pre flight information announcement the other issue wa a very mediocre in flight entertainment system which took an hour to get going and even the flight tracking information wa not available for the whole flight they weren t overly concerned just superficial apology the toilet were filthy and grimy the floor edge and all around the basin area where bit were falling off were thick with dirty grease i looked into the galley and that too including the floor and edge of preparation bench wa full of grime total disgrace the cabin crew seemed in a state of disorganised chaos having a great view of seeing it all from my seat very little contact with passenger other than rather arrogant look all round needless to say i will never travel ba long haul again they need to get on to an emirate airline and see how it should be done a a regular long haul traveller on emirate the difference between these company is indisputable perhaps the so called loyal ba customer have never been on a emirate flight to compare the difference,negative

b just returned from a london toronto london flight ba appear to be proud of their new dreamliner but they have scored a real own goal by cramming seat into each row the only way this ha been achieved is by fitting seat that are far narrower than the norm we are well used to airline having unjustifiably uncomfortable seat pitch but this wa the first time i have found myself wedged into such a narrow seat and i am quite slimly built unless ba change their s to a less cramped layout i will now have no alternative but to make sure i am not flying in a thus often avoiding ba altogether i will let a ba steward have the last word the first time i sat in one of these seat i could not believe how bad they are and he like me is slim come on ba start having a little regard for your customer comfort and health,positive

flown flight on ba recently generally satisfied though cost cutting in business class seems to have got out of hand club kitchen snack are shrinking with little left half way through long flight and meal and choice less although there are many new business class seat out there that are better ba is still acceptable especially the very private window seat crew usually excellent and baggage delivery consistent at terminal my one complaint over these flight would be that no effort is made to control the amount of hand baggage on board even on short flight boarding take so long while stressed crew are trying to find space for large and heavy bag when some people have two or three large bag each two out of six flight were delayed because of this while they offloaded some bag that would not fit recent flight with easyjet have not had this problem they enforce their rule so we all know where we stand,positive

flew from ist to lhr on september in short an abomination for a business class flight lasting nearly hour it started with a dirty dingy cramped lounge with very limited and low quality food and drink selection and located very far from the boarding gate i have used the star alliance lounge at ataturk airport and it is light year ahead of the ba lounge the plane wa an ancient b the business class seat had little leg room or recline were packed out hard and very uncomfortable it took hour for any drink or food service to start and we were served warm champagne and a small bag of stale nut this wa followed by a hot meal which wa totally different from that described in the menu which had been handed out and this became apparent only when the food service began there were only two choice nothing vegetarian the crew were disengaged disinterested and dismissive the entertainment system consisted of only several old screen suspended from the ceiling and showing the movie godzilla which doubtless wa a big hit with the year old in the audience at the end of the flight we were given fast track card to speed up our passage through custom unfortunately only of the fast track booth were open and we ended up effectively in the slow track line to add insult to injury this business class flight cost more than that of it competitor turkish airline and bore little resemblance to the business class service and cabin described on the ba website shame on british airway for this product,negative

ba yvr to lhr on august premium economy much below previous experience flying in this cabin on ba staff were indifferent and inattentive the meal were deplorable despite being a small cabin there wa only one meal choice left half way through the dinner service a very heavy and overly rich pasta dish accompanied by an equally heavy piece of dry chocolate cake hardly suitable food for a long flight breakfast wa worse an equally heavy fruit muffin and tea or coffee very poor a number of seat in this cabin have metal box underneath rendering the much advertised additional leg room useless ife far below what it used to be in term of quality and variety of programming a very unpleasant experience and definitely not worth the additional cost,negative

vie lhr li on sep both leg on an airbus in club europe business class both leg on time or almost on time with an excellent crew a most time with ba transfer procedure in lhr terminal were fast and friendly even the extra security check required for all transfer at lhr even intra eu were hassle free and easy the scheduled layover wa a rather long hour ba gallery lounge in lhr t wa also comfortable with excellent drink selection and quite good food selection i fly the vie li route regularly and surprisingly transferring at lhr is superior to most alternative on the vie li route especially to the more common alternative fra cdg and even am and bru with the possible exception of zrh so taking ba via lhr is a really good alternative if the direct tp flight is not an option for whatever reason the only negative i have to say that both flight featured the new ba slim seat which are really a huge step back in comfort compared to the old seating seat in club europe are economy seat with limited seat pitch and the middle seat left empty it just like flying with star alliance with their uncomfortable recaro slim seat catering on the vie lhr wa afternoon tea which is ba weakest club europe service with bland sandwich and acceptable scone even their chicken tikka sandwich in economy are better but they have full bar service and brilliant attentive fa s so i believe ba is still one of best option to fly within europe catering on the second leg wa a good prawn salad or a chicken dish however my luggage did not make it to li that day which wa an unwelcome and unexpected surprise after the long layover in heathrow but the issue wa handled well fast and friendly by groundforce the company who doe the luggage handling for ba in li and i received my luggage without any further hassle the next morning not a perfect score due ba s new seating the delayed luggage and the vie lhr catering but still pretty good service a a side note vie airport is getting worse and worse long line at security with only two of the available four line open ba us a shared lounge in vie which wa overcrowded with basically not a seat available to sit down and limited food service but at least ba us the old terminal which is still far superior to the new skylink terminal used by star alliance which really is a show piece how not to design a new terminal,positive

economy from jo burg to lax via heathrow both flight on a and both full comfortable flight on time and great service on the plane main problem is at heathrow at jo burg excellent arrangement for boarding the flight at heathrow insufficient space and just chaotic if jo burg can get it right surely ba can get it right at it premium hub heathrow and when arriving at heathrow the entrance to section c where we landed wa closed so we were unable to transfer direct to the gate instead we had to take the transit to section a go through the long line of security there and then go back to section c no one from ba or baa at the c gate to explain and when raised by ba customer service staff they were uninterested and a usual blamed baa rather than taking responsibility shame a the service in the air and at other airport is usually very good,positive

i have flown lhr bkk many time with eva emirate oman and qatar unfortunately this time i chose my national carrier disappointed is not the word to start with the seating arrangement is absurd all the others manage or ba manages abreast in a horrible tight arrangement whereby you face your neighbour when the hot towel were given out they were like warm rag in comparison to the other airline food ok there wa a selection on the menu however at service time i wa merely passed a tray over my neighbour on every qatar flight you are not only addressed by your name but the table is made for you a if being in a restaurant none of this with ba once the appetiser and first course are consumed you hand the bowl back to the attendent who then pass your main course to you in a bowl shabby is not the word after a reasonable sleep in a very narrow bed it wa time for landing with no sign of a priority immigration pas being given i asked the steward for one he replied they did not have any for this flight but assured me there would be ground staff at the gate to supply this basic amenity stupidly i believed him upon departure at bkk no ground staff or pass i return to the uk next week and for the first time ever i am dreading the experience never ever will i fly my national carrier again disgraceful it s any middle east airline again for me qatar being my preferred choice,negative

flew vie to lhr club europe fantastic crew looking after the club europe cabin the only let down is the new revamped club europe cabin i really do not believe what ba is saying that this is what their european passenger want the seat pitch ha now been reduced from inch to inch which used to be the charter airline seat pitch year ago if the passenger in front reclines their seat it is impossible to work on your laptop a there is no room i really am not able to justify paying the club europe fare for an economy class seat which is the most uncomfortable seat i have ever say in a number of passenger were not impressed with the new cabin and all felt badly let down by ba british airway used to be a class above the rest now they are just an average low cost carrier but still charge the high fare ba really need to think seriously about the club europe layout they have added more seat so it is all about money not about what their passenger really want,negative
first and last time flying with ba upgraded the of u to premium economy at each for of u a complete waste of money have done this with virgin on occasion for long haul flight and it so worth the money and not a expensive food terrible crew and staff not friendly no drink offered only when handing out food none of u could eat the food it wa so bad on a hour flight we were hungry don t waste your money upgrading i wish i had read review before i left,negative

booked a british airway holiday so that s flight and hotel from london city airport to florence peretola airport either it came up from the ba rep or my husband asked about an upgrade to business class and wa told that would be an extra for the return trip a it wa for a significant birthday he thought why not reason why no one should bother with this upgrade for this particular flight no separate ba lounge at either london city or peretola airport faster boarding entirely pointless when you all have to get onto a bus to take you to the aeroplane at florence bigger seat and more leg room they are small plane so the same throughout luggage off first no point when it take over an hour to get through custom at florence better meal yes choice of meat or fish very nice but worth each the ba rep should have told u about the lack of facility and suggest a hotel upgrade instead it wa a perfectly pleasant flight the holiday wa great but we paid an extra for no reason whatsoever,positive
when will they learn i flew ba to dubai last friday in business let me sum it up boring food surly crew dirty plane and expensive can the product get any more unimaginative the inflight entertainment wa out of touch with modern medium the screen so poor i couldn t see the movie and gave up the sandwich that you get when you land are so awful that i think any frequent flyer is awfully fed up with them the crew make you feel that you are in their way and the plane is again horribly dirty coffee wa spilt on all the wipeable area around my seat in business you expect better it is just not an enjoyable or fun experience by any mean and they never upgrade you or take care of their frequent flyer when i can i chose a different airline,negative

we flew ba gatwick to grenada first time with ba and only due to date having been dedicated virgin customer we upgraded to premium economy and apart from the extra leg room ideal for hubby but no odds to me at no benefit and total waste of money at almost double cost of upgrading with virgin service wa not great and food wa awful welcome on board drink in premium economy wa orange juice in round plastic carton virgin offer orange juice or champagne in a glass no idea what food wa on offer a no menu provided and just a disgruntled chicken or beef response when asked stewardess old and tatty plane very small tv first and last time flying with ba will change date of holiday in future to ensure virgin flight overall this over priced upgrade didn t even compare with virgin s economy service i would strongly recommend don t waste your money or better still go with virgin,positive

travelled with ba from rome to lhr staff at rome were wonderful what a contrast to heathrow entirely through my own fault i left my passport on the plane when i asked for assistance three member of staff at the helpdesk did anything but help in itself this may not seem terrible having got myself into this situation but when they did finally deign to speak to me they told me the plane had left i pointed out that the plane wa still outside the terminal building their response wa to ignore me i finally found one very polite helpful well informed and kind person who did help he wa a trolley collector,positive
london to budapest on club world now i don t even mention the fact that my luggage hasn t arrived but the price for club world is a huge rip off you can sit in the new slimline type of seat which is thinner than the previous one and some genius obviously thought that if they put in thinner seat why not squeeze in another extra row which mean that the leg space is less than half a it wa in the old day so exactly like in economy class so you pay dollar more for stale finger sandwich and a scone what a bargain shame on you ba for the lousy service will never fly with them again,negative
we flew premium economy on ba from boston to london then london to johannesburg the seat were comfortable and the leg room wa ample enough even for an over foot passenger the flight attendant were very attentive having flown air france premium economy in september i must say that the ba premium economy is much better than that in the french airline it wa really worth the extra money,positive
this wa the first long haul flight i d taken for year and i had high hope that our london cape town flight would be far more comfortable and pleasant than the budget carrier we ve used for european trip boy wa i wrong we were squeezed in so tightly it wa almost impossible to get out without injuring the poor person in the aisle seat and when the person in front reclined her seat my daughter could hardly move we had to ask a flight attendant to make the person put their seat upright so that we could eat our meal even worse i actually paid extra to choose our seat in advance thinking that a window and centre seat wouldn t be so bad come on british airway i know that at the moment they are the only airline offering a direct lhr cape town service but they can do better than that,positive
economy class on aug from london lhr to new york jfk boarding wa in terminal which i love a i can sit gatwick orlando gatwick club world both way b worth the money every penny of it crew on the outbound sector were fairly young and were a little rude seemed like everything wa a chore if you asked for something they hadn t got on the cart you couldn t have it polite enough but not really interested in the passenger crew inbound not being disrespectful but they were older and much nicer nothing wa too much bother if they hadn t got it there and then they got it right away for you lie flat bed comfortable enough and baggage allowance of bag per passenger is great for the shopping food and drink are good however i do think the food on thomson airway in premium is better than ba club world in form of scheduled carrier british airway are ten time better than virgin in so many way and would fly with ba again no question asked,positive
i m regularly flying perth hong kong london port of spain these day perth to london is via cathay pacific business class which is excellent sadly i then have to swap to ba for london to trinidad where club world is a euphemism for slum in the sky cathay pacific business class seat across the width of the aircraft ba club slum across if you re on a night flight that mean tripping over people or being tripped over decor is abysmal service is average to poor seat and personal space design is lousy but there s not much space to work with film choice is limited and the video screen is tiny and reminiscent of old analogue line tv of the s the overall impression is a dreary coffin like space with minimal storage crummy entertainment average food and indifferent service don t do it fly with someone else anyone else,negative
travelled lhr to montreal st august and montreal to lhr st september aircraft used wa a with class this sector doe not normally offer a first service so business class passenger were spread throughout the first and club world cabin all flight were on time and the cabin crew were excellent especially on the outward leg check in and baggage reclaim were smooth and efficient the lounge at terminal are looking tired and were rather dirty when we used them food choice wa limited although i did enjoy the hot soup seating in ba is dated and even ba s new first class seat is rather disappointing when compared to even business class on carry such a emirate or qatar food is well below par both in term of quality and quantity i know ba is struggling to make end meet but ultimately it ha to appreciate that people paying for premium cabin expect a certain experience and the seat and food make up a major element of that experience i guess there is little competition for ba on the north atlantic route but it help to explain why their share of route to the far east and australia are diminishing,positive
economy class on aug from london lhr to new york jfk boarding wa in terminal which i love a i can sit for some time in caffe nero have a coffee and watch airplane take off or land i choose ba just because of their terminal boarding went quite smoothly and the flight wa full it took about minute till we actually took off after the time we were supposed to the seat i had wasn t comfortable the cushion wa moving and the seat wasn t firm the inflight entertainment had a limited choice of movie which wa disappointing and the screen were small and sometimes were not working flight attendant were all woman who were polite and smiling they did their best to make it a pleasurable flight toilet were clean the headphone were broken and i had to ask for new one we landed on time it took minute till the plane could park and then another minute to get off because a the captain informed u there wa a long line at immigration and we would have to wait for them to give u the go ahead inside terminal there wa a huge line it took hour to finally reach an officer this wa by far the most annoying and tiring experience i have had to land at pm and get out at am is just too much i will now choose an airline that land in a terminal which can handle large number of passenger more effectively,positive
travelled a a family of four to the maldives despite numerous request many week in advance we didn t get seat together on the outbound journey the plane wa old and the entertainment system antiquated this seems to be an issue on ba route with little competition it wa a similar story when we flew club to mauritius on that trip the entertainment system failed all together on the return journey from male i watched what i thought to be a three part crime drama called the tunnel only after watching the third part did i discover that there wa a fourth or more why why would you not have all the story this experience aside many airline have better entertainment system in economy than the ba service in business on this route when you are paying this kind of money to take two child business class you want good entertainment to keep them occupied they don t need the space would also have been nice to sit together food wa grim my ten year old son who normally devours everything ate nothing on both leg of the trip a ten hour flight with travel at either end is a long time without food there seemed to be a hurry to serve the food throw a bottle of water at you and then shut down service until an hour before arrival on the outbound journey i pressed the service button after minute it self cancelled pressed again minute later it self cancelled i returned my glass to the galley myself the staff were so busy chatting amongst themselves they didn t notice me presumably this is why they didn t see the service request either on the return trip service wa a little chaotic and well below standard you should expect food wa equivalently poor this is the second ba business class trip i ve taken to the maldives and each time i have been disappointed given the cost i ve also travelled economy on emirate to male which wa actually better and business on emirate which wa fantastic i know ba have monopoly on the direct route from gatwick to male but i will be going via dubai on emirate in future,positive

i have flown twice with ba now in business class to and from delhi and i have to say it ha been absolutely poor me and a few colleague flew out to new delhi for a business trip ba were the pioneer of aircraft s after all they did create the concorde key word in that is were they ve basically turned into a no frill airline allow me to explain the blue worn carpet padded fabric seat with stain worn out grey plastic panel with little grain of grit and dirt get into and a tft which had the same image quality a vhs tape the decor look like it wa directly taken out of the film airplane you still get the odd knock on the leg when economy passenger are boarding then plane with hand luggage a there is no private space staff were fine but flying business class a customer should get a wow factor and there wa none the plastic translucent slider that divide the seat had been battered from being shifted up and down when the crew serve the food and drink the toilet are exactly the same a economy except in business class they stick a plastic flower in a glass the food wa ok but again nothing special normally it the little thing that make the difference but with ba they need a total make over for a flight that happens everyday from london to delhi ba should be doing more the decor of the plane matched the experience i got with ba dull i won t be flying long haul with them again my advice avoid ba and before you book your flight have a look online at what other airline can offer you,positive

i flew from london to sydney club world business class having done similar oz flight recently with qatar airline the experience wa like comparing the premium to third division football club everything about ba wa shoddy shabby and second rate so sad numerous example from the business lounge the lay out of the cabin the comfort of the seat privacy food service all second rate and for about k extra flight cost why i would seriously consider flying to sydney via perth next time longer but an experience where you arrive feeling caressed not bundled along really pain me to say this a very poor way to present a country s airline,negative
ba th august in my mind that when i bought the ba ticket it would be a great flight experience based on their reputation a a star airline it turned out to be totally wrong i used to travel with other airline it seems that my flight experience with ba from changi airport to heathrow wa the worst in so many way not worth money spent at all firstly the seat space wa really small i cant imagine those who are bigger than i am because i am a medium size person secondly the proportion of food served wa not generous in comparison to other airline they only served food twice for that hour long haul journey thirdly the service wa considered moderate and it seemed like no one cared about the toilet in economy class no one bothered to top up the toilet roll lastly the inflight entertainment wa so back dated the movie selection must have been year old flimsy earphone and outdated screen all in all an unhappy customer,negative

flight from heathrow to newark the new dreamliner wa fantastic very comfortable quiet and clean the cabin crew were superb very professional with customer service being their priority i appreciate that flying on a new aircraft make a difference to the flight however if ba continue to invest in their fleet and maintain and excellent level of customer service i can see no other reason to fly with another carrier especially when considering ba s avios point usage which allows all of your point to be spent on flight virgin however dictate how many point you can spend on each flight i ve flown with ba and virgin many time it wa a nice attempt by virgin advertising themselves in terminal however when you re sat in terminal after experiencing a quick and easy run through the terminal about to board a brand new aircraft it s hard to see the advertisement working,positive
great service from lcy anger in western france on embraer london city airport is so very convenient for london dweller and the flight were very comfortable saturday flight outbound wa totally full but on time attentive cabin crew very comfortable and not even the breakfast of a disappointingly hard croissant with ham and cheese could spoil the positive impression coming back on the wednesday wa less than half full so double drink and snack all round ticket were return which seems very reasonable considering the alternative for the region is ryanair to tour from stansted for almost a much and once you factor in the extra price of luggage and snack with them ba win hand down,positive
flight august glasgow to london city cancelled with no explanation typical ba service nobody about to assist with alternative arrangement or any concept of customer care so much for the world favourite airline third rate which is what i have come to expect from them,negative
li lhr on july j class on an airbus i wa expecting more however i wa disappointed seat wa ok but not particularly comfortable food just average with a choice of a fruit or meat platter either very poor cabin crew in an automatic mode no smiling whatsoever more interested in chatting in front of the cabin and complaining about not sure what no inflight entertainment altogether not even a shared movie however we departed on time and arrived min before schedule and the price wa the cheapest ever for a business class seat will fly ba again but i am more keen to intercontinental flight where the quality is superior than european route,positive
upgraded from premium economy to business from yvr vancouver to lhr london the club world cabin wa full and a couple of the passenger had been upgraded to first despite this the staff were friendly and helpful although the food wasn t that great the chocolate desert wa delicious though seat is nice and wide but if you re facing rearward on the you could be sitting right next to someone you don t know the ife had a lot of choice and had many new movie to chose from altogether a good flight,positive
upgraded to business class on return flight from verona absolute disgrace flight left around pm but lounge closed at pm lounge wa awful dirty and very little in the way of business class facility flight wa cattle class and i have seen more organisation and courtesy on an easyjet flight boarding wa like a rugby scrum with no priority boarding and then spent minute on an a bus with no air conditioning crammed packed in hot condition flight had run out of food worst flight in memory and absolute shocking customer service absolute joke and how they have the audacity to claim it wa business class they should be accountable n the trade description act,negative
am lcy economy embraer aircraft only half full at most and on time for such a short flight a high standard of cabin service with wine and a small snack offered an excellent flight in all respect,positive
porto lhr economy pushed back late but arrived on time flight wa full but good cabin service with sandwich and drink a very good standard overall,positive
toronto to london in wtp on a and london to toronto in club world on there were element of both flight where ba seemed to be back to their old self the dreamliner in wtp wa on time with some of the best cabin service i ve experienced from a male attendant who smiled couldn t do enough and wa just professional ba seemed to have dropped some of the nice touch though so no hot towel soft drink before take off or menu card look like wtp seems to have been demoted again fast bar service and good entree before the wtp service morphed into wt for breakfast which ha reverted to muffin or nuffin and t and c and juice from paper cup it really is an insult after an overnight flight and is ill thought out and penny pinching landing early at heathrow and fast bag ended a good overall flight the return flight in club wa one of my best ever the lounge had a better range of hot and cold food though most of the furniture still need replacing on board two male crew upstairs on the jumbo were superb friendly helpful and starting off well with a nd champagne before take off due to delay in boarding fast bar service and an excellent lunch with the sea bass being exceptional a calm oasis on the upper deck allowed some sleep before the now tired afternoon tea wa served real personalised service with a smile reminded me of old time of ba at it s best an on time landing and fast bag off finished an excellent flight why can t they do this more often answer variable cabin crew,positive
lhr lax a aircraft wa clean seat were comfortable but the leg space wa restricted by the ife computer which ha been installed underneath the seat in front amenity kit contained a cushion blanket headphone and toothbrush there were no eye shade and ear plug food both way the same selection tikka masala or macaroni and cheese of average quality followed by a small ice cream and a sandwich or breakfast croissant fa s lacked courteousness friendliness and motivation there wa on both flight repeatedly no reaction to the call button and they were several hour not present in the cabin ife system is good with a big selection of movie documentary etc due to a malfunction the system had to be restarted which erased the preference this experience with british airway is not compatible to other flag carrier due to the lack in service and the restricted seating,positive
lhr sin july upgraded from wtp to club world before i even had the chance to ask value for money wa a because i didn t pay for the flight flight went well and i even managed some sleep on the fold flat bed cabin crew were pleasant and helpful one of the attendant retrieved his own usb adapter from his luggage so that i could charge my phone i wa a little surprised that there wasn t a usb port at my seat upstairs the same attendant appeared in the passport control hall and called out without success unfortunately looking for a passenger who had left his glass behind food wa absolutely fine and the burgundy a little too drinkable this wa probably up there a one of the better flight i ve taken most are done under sufferance but this one wa pretty good overall,positive
th july lgw to orlando drink service from the crew wa good champagne upon boarding and a top up without requesting it wa greatly appreciated food wa not outstanding but pleasant enough overall the cabin service wa good several service of drink and top ups when requested what let this flight down wa the number of unruly child on this flight i wa in an outside seat on the port side and an or year old child in front got out of her seat every five minute or so continually throughout the flight and her younger sibling wa also jointing her when she did manage to stay put i attempted to avail myself of the flat bed but three time these child stood on my leg a they clambered over into their seat the parent of these child never once intervened to check their child s behaviour although they were well aware of how they were behaving my wife did not have much luck either the couple to her rear were sat throughout the flight crossed legged in the isle playing with their child and their toy and my wife had to struggle passed them every time she wished to use the toilet surely a tripping hazard there were many other child on the flight who were well behaved so it can be done if parent set boundary for their offspring whilst ba cannot be held responsible for child s behaviour i feel that a we were in the club world cabin some sort of announcement should be made by ba requesting passenger with child respect the comfort of fellow passenger p s the club lounge at gatwick wa like a kindergarten but that is another story,positive
